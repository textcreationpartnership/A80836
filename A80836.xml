         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:172571:3"/>League and Covenant: and that in diſſenting from them, and oppoſing my private apprehenſions to their more prudent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I muſt needs expoſe my ſelf to the reproach of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, inconſiderate heat, peeviſhneſs of ſpirit, and contract on my ſelf the frowns of men in power, and frettings of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying brethren, and fellow-confederates, and fail the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my own preferment, which my courage and conſtancy for His Majeſties juſt intereſt in the worſt of oppreſſing times, and utmoſt of oppoſition (wherein many who now vilifie the Covenant, durſt not ſpeak, nay did baſely comply and promiſe, <hi>to be true and faithful to the Common-wealth of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>as it was then eſtabliſhed without a King and Houſe of Lords)</hi> had heightned in both my friends and foes; againſt which, when I <hi>reaſon with fleſh and blood,</hi> and conſult a proud heart within, and numerous family without me, I find ſufficient Arguments (according to the dictates of nature) to determine folly againſt my ſelf; but I hope I <hi>have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True piety doth ſuggeſt and convince me, that <hi>wiſdom to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, is folly to the world;</hi> and the Watchmans <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is to proclaim an approaching evil, whilſt at a diſtance, capable of diverſion, and eſcape; and that the moſt wiſe of Gods Miniſters in all ages, judged it their duty <hi>to oppoſe Gods Word</hi> to mens prevailing luſt, and <hi>preſent propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto wickedneſs: Elijah</hi>-like to ſtand alone, and ſpeak the mind of God, when for ſo doing they may be branded as the <hi>troublers of Iſrael,</hi> when indeed their ſin, not the preachers ſpeach, doth cauſe the commotion; with <hi>Micaiah</hi> to denounce the danger of <hi>Ahabs</hi> deſign, though <hi>400 Prophets</hi> encourage it, and King, and the Court encline to it: and with <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> to ſay to the King, <hi>Keep thy Oath, and thou ſhalt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi> when Princes and Prophets perſwade the breach thereof, and himſelf muſt down into the Dungeon as <hi>a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of ſedition:</hi> Few men will deny, that <hi>Roger Bacon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:172571:3"/>in his plain preaching to King <hi>Henry 3.</hi> that if <hi>he did not remove his malignant counſellors,</hi> Peter <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, <hi>and</hi> Peter de Rivallis, <hi>he could never be at quiet,</hi> played a wiſer part than did the Biſhop, who, to pleaſe the Kings humor, preached up the Kings prerogative to ſuch a pitch, as brought himſelf under an Anathema, from which he was forced to appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> for relief: And all good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants will conclude <hi>Cranmer</hi> was much wiſer in alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding King, Council Parliament, Lords temporal &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, in the caſe of <hi>K.

            </p>
            <p>Magnanimity is a vertue not the leaſt neceſſary to a man, but moſt neceſsary to a Chriſtian, and moſt of all to a Miniſter, who ſhould like his Steeple ſtand in all ſtorms (raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, and by the variations of human affairs) and not like the Weather cock turn with every wind.

            <p>It is worth remembrance, that <hi>Religion and its Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> never was, nor muſt now be expected, to be <hi>the reſult of an ordinary meaſure of reſolution:</hi> It is needleſſe to recite the boldneſs of the <hi>Apoſtles and Primitive Fathers</hi> againſt the contradiction of the Pagans; <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </head>
               <p>WHilſt we conſider this Propoſition, and frame this Link of our Chain, we muſt take the Covenant in its <hi>abſtracted form,</hi> as it is a <hi>Solemn Compact confirmed by an Oath,</hi> in which God is witneſs, or party, or both.

               <p>Conform hereunto was the commendable carriage of <hi>Gyth</hi> the younger brother, but faithful Counſellor to <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> who conſidering the ſtate of the Quarrel between him and <hi>William Conqueror,</hi> gave the King this warning,

               <p>Every man is, in charity, bound to be an Angel to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful <hi>Jacob,</hi> in point of his vow to God, and Monitor to his back-ſliding brother; but it <hi>especially belongs to Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> who being Gods <hi>Watchmen againſt ſin,</hi> and his peoples <hi>Remembrancers unto duty,</hi> are not onely by <hi>common Charity,</hi> but alſo by <hi>ſpecial Office,</hi> bound to give warning againſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, contracting guilt, and impending judgments of God;

Ezek.</hi> 17.15. for in caſe of ſilence the ſin will be on their heads, and the ſtones in the ſtreet will cry out.</p>
               <p>This is a principle ſo common and clear,
<note place="margin">The duty ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from piety towards God.</note> that none profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Reaſon or Religion dare deny it; and the reaſon of it is written in ſuch legible Characters, that all may run and read it, (viz.) <hi>The Covenant is an Oath, the higheſt appeal to God, who muſt not, will not be mocked, or made a witneſs to His own
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172571:12"/>diſhonour, but will puniſh the breach thereof as a moſt heinous ſin.</hi> Therefore the Miniſters of God (ſtanding in his ſtead) muſt with all zeal exact the accompliſhment of it, as the <hi>practice of piety dependant on ſuch a piece of worſhip:</hi> Remembring God hath ſtrictly charged, That <hi>if a man vow a vow, and bind his ſoul, he ſhall not break his word, he ſhall do according to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of his mouth,</hi> Numbers 30.2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Loyalty to the King</hi> is no little ſwaſive to this duty;
<note place="margin">2.

Can any true <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> and Liege Subject, without horror call to mind the perjury of King <hi>Harold,</hi> which let in <hi>William Conqueror</hi> to our Land? and how King <hi>John</hi> was made odious, and deſerted by this out-cry, <hi>Withdraw your ſelves from a perjured King,</hi> and not in ſence thereof be ſtirred up with zeal to aſſert the Covenant? which bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, will load with ſhame, and ſubject to the diſpleaſure of that God who can deſtroy both us and our King, ſo happily reſtored to each other.</p>
               <p>True Loyalty is no leſs ſtudious to eſtabliſh the Kings Throne in Righteouſneſs, than obſequious to the Royal expreſſions of His Pleaſure: Yet to ſuch as center Loyalty in the laſt, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe that they would ſeriouſly conſider, That howſoever His late Majeſty of Honorable Memory (for the conſcience of his Oath) was acted by the miſapprehenſion of the Covenant <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict it;</hi> yet he was more ſenſible of its obliging force <hi>when ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> than to attempt the <hi>diſcharge thereof;</hi> and therefore in His

                  </note> but avail not to diſcharge the Oath when taken. Well doth the <hi>Oxford</hi> Profeſſor diſtinguiſh, and tell us, They are two ſeveral queſtions to be diſtinctly reſolved according to the condition into which a man is caſt: The one is an <hi>hoc vel illudi juramentum ſit licitum,</hi> whether the Oath be lawful?

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:172571:15"/>whether the Oath do bind? For that Oath may be <hi>unlawfully ſworn,</hi> which muſt everlaſtingly bind when ſworn. That ſin is to be avoided in entring into a Covenant or Oath, which may be repented of without retraction of the Oath when ſworn: The Name of God too many times is (though it ought not to be) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain by <hi>raſh ſwearing,</hi> yet muſt not be blaſphemed by <hi>forſwearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Oath is an obligation ſo ſacred and permanent, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conditions are required unto a regular acting of it. At firſt it ſhould be the act of a deliberate, not diſtempered mind; not the effect of a diſtreſſed condition; clearly propounded, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally received, not obtained by fraud, nor impoſed by force: But where, in any, or all theſe, and the l ke, there is a defect, and diſorder, or miſcarriage, that men with <hi>Jeptha</hi> raſhly ſwear ſuch a general Oath, as may rob them of the deareſt of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights when it comes to performance: Or with <hi>Zedekiah</hi> be beſieged by Warres without, and Tumults within; to covenant, and confirm by Oath, conditions diſhonorable and burdenſome: Or with <hi>Joſhua and the Princes of Iſrael to the Gibeonites,</hi> ſwear beyond their intention, and almoſt the import of their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there being an apparent fallacy in the foundation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of the contract; yet in theſe and many the like caſes the rule is moſt certainly to be admitted, <hi>Quod fieri non debuit, factum valet,</hi> theſe things ought not to have been done, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, do bind the conſcience.</p>
               <p>I wonder how men can preſs this Rule in caſe of Baptiſm by Women, or Children, and Lay-perſons, (in whom I humbly conceive it cannot hold) and not regard it in an Oath, whoſe nature is ſuch as adminiſtreth a Reaſon for this Rule, and makes it neceſſary.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172571:22"/>and probable means to preſerve Religion from ruine:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then Sir, the weather was very miſty about <hi>Oxford,</hi> and made their minds very muddy, that they could not conceive <hi>entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenants, and Solemn Leagues,</hi> dictated by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and directed by the Law of God, purſued and practiſed by all Nations, (and by <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the caſes of their Religion,) as the utmoſt of humane policy, and higheſt of ſecurity to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges endangered, as a method detecting concealed enmity, debarring fraud, expreſſing affection, engaging conſcience, and animating reſolution, to be a <hi>lawful, proper, and probable meanes of ſecurity.</hi> If it be good and ſafe as to our <hi>Civil,</hi> I hope it is no leſs probable in our <hi>Religious concernments.</hi> If Sir, I had been to deale with one ſingle ſtudent, I muſt have told him, That he ſtarted this exception more like a Sophiſtical Diſputant, than a conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dubitant.</p>

                  <p>Let me therefore enquire whether they knew <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have been <hi>Gods people of another Nation,</hi> and that they entered into Covenant in the time of the Judges, in the dayes of <hi>Joaſh, Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Hezekiak,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in times of danger and defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>But I preſume, none will be ſo childiſh, as to ſay or think the <hi>Purity of Religion, Honour and Authority of the King, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament, Liberty of the Subject, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Kingdom,</hi> are <hi>trifles;</hi> than which, no matters can be more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and needful to us, as men or Chriſtians: Nor is it of any force to ſay, Theſe were ſecured by <hi>Laws and Profeſſion of a lawful and Religious King;</hi> whilſt theſe did not expel the ſpirit of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the matter was of that weight, as to render an Oath and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant neceſſary.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, An Oath is <hi>unlawful</hi> when the matter of it is <hi>impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> for <hi>ad impoſſibile Nemo teneatur;</hi> whether the impoſſibility be in the nature of the thing, or action converſant about it; but our Solemne League and Covenant is free from any appearance of <hi>impoſſibility</hi> in the <hi>nature of the things covenanted:</hi> I hope the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, and preſervation of humane order, peace, and unity, will be owned as poſſibilities beyond the <hi>Learning of an Aſſe:</hi>

                     <p>Nor is there any impoſſibility chargeable on the <hi>Act,</hi> which is all along limited unto an <hi>endeavour according to our ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings:</hi> which might methinks have ſatisfied the ſame Queſtioniſts; that, though <hi>Baniſhment or Death be extirpating Acts,</hi> yet they might be out of his place and calling, and other Acts did to him particularly belong.</p>
                     <p>Let it here be noted, that though the <hi>Law</hi> were (as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) againſt ſomething ſworn in this Covenant, yet this puts not a <hi>moral impoſſibility</hi> upon the ſame; for that a National Oath is the moſt full and authentick Repeal and diſcharge of former Laws, or the thing ſworn may be effected by a meek and humble endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in our places and callings, to have that Law voided, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
                     <p>And as to what impoſſibility did ſeem to lie upon the <hi>extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſome things in this Covenant ſworn to be extirpated by reaſon of the <hi>Coronation Oath of His late conſcientious Majeſty,</hi> it was greater in <hi>appearance</hi> than in <hi>reality:</hi> For, the Oath of a Prince may be vacated by the impoſſibility put on it by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Oath of the people, though tumultuouſly ſworn, as it was in the reſcue of <hi>Jonathan</hi> from King <hi>Sauls</hi> Oath:

                     <p>The unlawfulneſſe which I find charg'd on the matter of the Covenant, is uſually accidental in ſome circumſtances converſant about the <hi>Act,</hi> more than the <hi>matter ſw rne,</hi> and hath been produced as a juſt barre to the taking of the Covenant, but is in vain now produced to break its bonds laid upon us, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted.

                  </p>
                  <p>In which reaſon it is to be noted,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They had ſome underſtanding of the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church of</hi> Scotland; and that little might ſo farre enlighten their judgment, as lawfully to ſwear the preſervation thereof: I preſume many Citizens have little and but general notion of the Liberties they ſwear to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, yet are judged to ſwear in judgment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I wonder <hi>an Vniverſity, and Proteſtant Vniverſity,</hi> converſing in all Books, (and I muſt imagine) meeting with the two Books of the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> their Confeſſion of Faith, and Form of Worſhip. entertaining School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Biſhops, thence fled, by reaſon of the ſame; and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppugning and diſputing againſt the ſame, ſhould profeſs they had thereof <hi>little understanding;</hi> but it may be they minded not to ſtudy theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Some underſtanding</hi> in the Religion of another Kingdom <hi>was neceſſary</hi> to them as <hi>Chriſtians and Proteſtants,</hi> by vertue of the Communion of the Church; and ſome as <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> and Proteſtant School of Learning, where the true Religion of the Reformed Churches was to be defended, duobts diſſolved, and errors oppugned and contradicted; and ſome was neceſſary, to them as <hi>Subjects,</hi> required to ſwear the preſervation thereof for the injunction could not but provoke an enquiry after the matter to be preſerved: I wonder therefore how theſe men could profeſs it did not concern them to have much, who (if I miſtake not) ought to know as much as all the Nation beſides: but from what they know, they adde the next Reaſon, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

                  <p>I wonder Sir, what account of the <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and Government of the Church of</hi> Scotland was by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of thoſe unhappy times, brought unto the knowledge of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford?</hi> I hope they were more wiſe and juſt than to take it from Mr. <hi>John Maxwel,</hi> pretended Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> (a man excommunicated by the Church, and cenſured by the State of that Kingdom, a profeſſed Enemy, and enraged De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, curſing his very Judges) whom I find about that time at <hi>Oxford,</hi> writing his <hi>Iſſachars Burden,</hi> (a moſt railing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful diſcovery of the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi>) and the rather, for that the heat of expectation and oſtentation of many (in reference to that book) was cooled by a providential fire which ſeiz'd on the Printing-Houſe, and burned the Copies ready to be publiſhed the next day, as Mr. <hi>Baylie in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government of that Church</hi> (which theſe Gentlmen might have met with) doth teſtifie.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. What are the things they find in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> which tend (in their thinking) to Superſtition and Schiſm?

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172571:28"/>and the ſetting up thereof the erecting of the Throne of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and this they referre to Schiſm. Sure Sir, they were in a great ſtrait, that made a ſhift to ſpecifie theſe ſad corruptions; but yet they do not tell us, where they find theſe laid down as the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> whether in their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or form of Diſcipline; Whilſt in their Confeſſion of Faith they give unto general Aſſemblies <hi>authority about Ceremonies,</hi>

                  <p>The firſt whereof,

                  </p>
                  <p>A very fair and ſpecious exception! To which, Sir, I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is well, <hi>Scandal is</hi> at length become an Argument of any force: Had it been regarded when rightly pleaded by the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> (enemies to ſeparation, as well as Popery) there might not have been <hi>a Solemn League and Covenant</hi> to conſtrain its plea in a caſe wherein (under correction) it ſeems to have loſt its force: For if, Sir, we have through ignorance practiſed, or wilfulneſs perſiſted in any ſinful Superſtitious courſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which we have been admoniſhed by ſome, and declined by others, and yet being armed with power did conſtrain a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with us, ſo that a Receſſion from the ſame muſt be our ſhame, and their ſcandal to whom we would not hearken; I hope we muſt not, for fear thereof, go on in ſin, and refuſe ſo much as <hi>to endeavour a Reformation:</hi> If in this caſe ſcandal had been of any force, how, or when had Proteſtant Religion been effected by ſuch who had burned for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> all that were but ſuſpected of inclining to it?

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ized as now? Is Scandal of any more force in the following degrees of Reformation, than in the firſt act thereof? Though it is a ſtop to ſin, and ſtay of violence in impoſing things indifferent, muſt it be of any ſtrength to barre duty in the endeavors of Reformation? I believe, Sir, profeſſors of Phyſick and Chirurgery, will not conſent ill humors to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purged, or feſtred, incurable members uncut off, becauſe ſome will be ſcandalized, that their advice was not ſooner minded, and others at the paſt, real, and now-ſeeming cruelty acted by the preſent change.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to me ſtrange, to ſee <hi>Papiſts and Separatists</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned as objects of the ſame ſcandal: I am ſure the reaſon and ground muſt be directly contrary; <hi>Continuance</hi> of corruption to the one; and <hi>Removal</hi> thereof to the other; the <hi>Separatiſt</hi> is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172571:30"/>offended that there were ſo <hi>many</hi> Popiſh Ceremonies retained, and that <hi>ſo long,</hi> when by him too rigidly reſiſted: The <hi>Papiſt</hi> that there were ſo <hi>few,</hi> and likely to be gone <hi>ſo ſoon:</hi> But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they are ſuppoſed <hi>in aliquo tertio convenire,</hi> to agree in ſome other capacity; The things are now to be Reformed; for non-obſervance of which they were both afflicted; and then Sir,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Scandal</hi> ſeems to be a meer fancy ſpringing from a fallacy in theſe words, <hi>The Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England;</hi> which theſe ſerious Caſuiſts (with reverence may I note it) do to me ſeem ſophiſtically to underſtand in a ſence dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the words of the Covenant, which are theſe, <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion in the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Diſcipline, and Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt therefore be obſerved, that <hi>Religion</hi> as it denoteth the <hi>matter,</hi> ſabſtantial <hi>parts,</hi> and eſſential <hi>form</hi> of divine Worſhip, is different from the <hi>Circumſtances, Ord r, and Ceremonies</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed thereunto, and only as appendants thereof deemed <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> which are converſant about, and ſeparable from Religion, liable to alteration as the prudence of men doth direct; and none but ignorant Idiots will deem the change of them <hi>a charge of Religion;</hi> for theſe are different in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> whom yet, (I hope) the <hi>Univerſitie of Oxford</hi> will own to be of the <hi>ſame Proteſtant Religion</hi> with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> agreeing in the <hi>ſame faith,</hi> though not ſubſcribing the <hi>ſame formal indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Articles;</hi> adminiſtring the <hi>ſame worſhip,</hi> though not in the <hi>ſame order,</hi> and with the <hi>ſame Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again Sir, we muſt diſtinguiſh between what is <hi>establiſhed,</hi> and what is <hi>exerciſed</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> Though we do not juſtifie, nay, believe a neceſſity of Reformation in many particulars in the <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government eſtabliſhed;</hi> yet we know in all theſe particulars, many groſs and abſurd corruptions brought in, and continued by a ſtrong hand, were exerciſed <hi>in the Kingdom of England;</hi> and that in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to all theſe particulars: 1. For Doctrine, as <hi>that auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſſion and pennance was neceſſary and profitable for Chriſtian men, and in Chriſts Church; That Chriſtians muſt have Altars, and bow to them as towards Gods mercy-ſeat, and the place of Chriſt his real preſence on earth: That Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:172571:30"/>and his paſſion are offered up as a Sacrifice in the Sacrament of the Altar: That Crucifixes, Images, and Pictures of Chriſt, God, and Saints, may be lawfully and profitably uſed and ſet up in Churches: That the Pope or Papacy is not Antichriſt: That there are Canonical houres of prayer which ought to be obſerved: That Churches, Altars, Chalices, and Church-yards, ought to be conſecrated: That men had free-will of themſelves to believe and repent: That men might totally and finally fall from grace: That Sunday is no Sabbath: That Biſhops have a Superiority of Order and Juriſdiction above other Ministers, and that by Divine Right. Nor can there be a true Church, where there are not ſuch Biſhops:</hi> Theſe and many ſuch like (it is well known) were <hi>publickly preached</hi> by <hi>Mountague, Cozens, Pocklington, Shelford, Dowe, Reeves, Adams,</hi> and others, and the Preachers defended even in the Univerſity from cenſure for them; nay, theſe were <hi>Printed</hi> in ſeveral Books of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, licenſed and allowed by the Archbiſhop and his Chaplains, and many of them <hi>aſſerted in the viſitation Articles</hi> of ſome Biſhops, and yet were not eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ſo <hi>in worſhip,</hi> many corruptions were innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exerciſed: As, <hi>Bowing at the Name of Jeſus: The turning Communion-Tables into Altars, or Altarwiſe, and Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in, furniſhing them with Candleſticks and Tapers: Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, the bleſſing, and other parts of the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to that place encloſed, and bowing to theſe Altars: The making Crucifixes and Canopies, pictures of God, Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin Mary, and other Saints in our Church-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: Conſecration of Churches, Fonts, Bells,</hi> and the like: All which, and many ſuch, were firſt innovated to the Chappel at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and ferried over to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and ſo tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Cathedral, and almoſt all Pariſh Churches; and yet were not eſtabliſhed by Law, though enforced by the corruption of Diſcipline in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitation Articles</hi> of Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Peircy,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and others in their ſeveral Dioceſſes; and by the ſilencing, ſuſpenſion, excommunication, and impriſonment, and High Commiſſion vexation of Mr. <hi>Chauncey Vicar,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Ware,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burros</hi> of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Nor was <hi>Government</hi> any more pure, if we conſider
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172571:31"/>how it was exerciſed in the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> and <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> with all rigor, cruelty, and injuſtice; and in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitations, Citations, Probate of VVills, Letters of Adminiſtration and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi> in the name, and under the Seal of the Biſhops themſelves, never authorized thereunto: All which were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently needful to be reformed, as having been ſo publickly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and potently defended, and might well enforce a covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted endeavor to reform Religion in the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I well know, Sir, that the <hi>change of Religion</hi> makes a great ſound in the world, eſpecially if <hi>establiſhed:</hi> I cannot be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the noiſe made by it againſt our <hi>firſt Reformation,</hi> and muſt expect the Eccho to follow all after acts and degrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for all changes are <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and many very dangerous: If therefore theſe Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Oxford</hi> could rationally conceive the Covenant to bind them to endeavor <hi>a change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the ſubſtance, matter, and eſſential parts and form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> then I muſt confeſs their exception is very important; for we cannot deny that our <hi>Biſhops, Martyrs, and Learned Divines, have by Suffering and Writing teſtified it to have been agreeable to the Word of God:</hi> And that to reſolve that into the power and pleaſure of a Parliament (who may direct and authorize the profeſſion, but not preſcribe the matter or form) were to make it <hi>a Parliamentary Religion;</hi> and the change thereof muſt needs condemn our <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment of Papiſts not joyning with us</hi> as unjuſt, and ſo <hi>juſtifie Papist and Separatiſt; the one in his recuſancy, and the other in his ſeparation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Sir, when I conſider the <hi>Religion of Scotland</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the concomitant and provocation, the <hi>VVord of God</hi> to be the Rule; and the <hi>beſt reformed Churches</hi> (profeſſing the ſame ſubſtantial Religion, though differing in adminiſtration and order) propounded as the pattern; I ſee not how right reaſon can render any ſuch ſence of it; and the rather, for that <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> not alteration of Religion, is the <hi>formal act</hi> which preſuppoſeth the continuation of the ſubject about which it is converſant.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, if they (as they needs muſt) by Religion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>the order and annexed Ceremonies appendant to Religion,</hi> whether eſtabliſhed, as was <hi>the Croſs in Baptiſm, holineſſe of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172571:31"/>dayes, and order of the Liturgy,</hi> and the like; or only exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and enforced by Prelates power and countenance, as the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions before mentioned;</hi> then we muſt ſay their exception is of no weight, not the reaſon any thing worth; for this change can be no ſuch <hi>ſcandal,</hi> as is conceived; for we deny them to have been teſtified by <hi>our Biſhops, Martyrs, and learned men, by any Sufferings or Writings</hi> (untill of late by the perſons and ſuch like before mentioned) <hi>as agreeable to the Word of God;</hi> and muſt put them to the proof of it; we think we are able to produce <hi>Tindal, Latimer, Hooper, Ridley, Farrar,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Martyrs, by laying down their <hi>Biſhopricks,</hi> and other conteſts and ſufferings to have teſtified againſt them, and Mr. <hi>Cartwright, Baines,</hi> and many <hi>Devonſhire, Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire</hi> Miniſters, and others, ever ſince the Reformation by Writing, Petition, Remonſtrance, Apology, and Sufferings to have teſtified againſt not only the <hi>corruptions exerciſed</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which our <hi>Jewel, Fulk, Whitaker,</hi> Archbiſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Dr. <hi>Brownrigge,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and all ſound and learned Divines, not devoted to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> have written) but even the <hi>very Order and Ceremonies eſtabliſhed,</hi> as being <hi>not agreeable to the Word of God:</hi> And if theſe learned Gentlemen had pleaſed to obſerve the <hi>Viſitation and high Commiſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> they might have found <hi>Prynn, Burton, Baſtwick Layton, Workman, Langley, Hind, Nichols, Ball,</hi> and many others (known learned men) who were ſilenced, ſuſpended, impriſoned, ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized: and in much Sufferings teſtified, theſe appendants to our Religion, whether eſtabliſhed or exerciſed, to be no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God; and I know not whom they can ment on as a Martyr for them, unleſs it be <hi>Lawde the late Archbiſhop,</hi> the grand Innovator of our Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If therefore our Religion be by Papiſts or Prelates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as <hi>a Parliamentary Religion,</hi> we will rejoyce in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and bleſs God we had a Parliament that had zeal to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their power about thoſe things that were properly ſubject thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor can this Reformation <hi>juſtifie the recuſancy of the Papiſts,</hi> becauſe theſe things never became a Reaſon for their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy,</hi> further than they occaſioned their obduracy by aſſuring their hopes of <hi>Englands</hi> return to them: Nor the <hi>Separation

                  <p>To theſe reaſons, Sir, I ſhould have anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Credit</hi> is indeed a matter of concerment, and <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to be regarded, and our <hi>Eſtate</hi> by all juſt, prudent meanes duely preſerved; but they are not equivalent to the <hi>purity</hi> of Goſpel adminiſtrations, nor muſt be admitted barres to duy, or ſtays from the endeavour of a neceſſary Reformation when called for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are at a loſs to underſtand their terms; the <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Law</hi> is not expreſſed in the Covenant; and many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions we have noted, were exerciſed, not eſtabliſhed: The endeavour of a Reformation of them (though not them only) was, and is required; and it is very doubtful how or where to find and prove <hi>an eſtabliſhment by law,</hi> to which they ſo much cleave; yet I hope the defect in proof thereof, will be no juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murre to the endeavour of a Reformation of what is really <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and corrupt,</hi> whether eſtabliſhed, or only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo entreat a comment on theſe words, <hi>the practice of the Catholick Church.</hi> It is well known, that <hi>Rome</hi> doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs and monopolize this Epithite: nor can the <hi>Worſhip, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Diſcipline of the Church of England</hi> admit it to be predicated of any ſo well as that; for all reformed Churches do in their practice differ (and I preſume it will be hard to prove the agreement of the Primitive Churches) in theſe particulars, which were firſt derived from Apoſtate <hi>Rome,</hi> and have ever ſince continued as the dregs of their Catholick practices, not more to the grief of the Reformed Churches abroad, and <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> at home, then joy and exultation of the Children of that Church, as a plain evidence of their continued poſſeſſion, and encouragement to expect and endeavor a full recovery of <hi>England</hi> into her boſom: But as to their Argument;</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government might be vitious and corrupt,</hi> notwithſtanding their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and aſſent to the contrary, or the ſubſcription of others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law. We well know, that the Reformation of the Church in <hi>England,</hi> was begun on more
<note n="*" place="margin">Henry the 8th his diſcontent at the Pope.</note> Political than pious principles; which did eaſily conſent to a retaining of what (was juſtly diſcharged in other Rerormed Churches, embracing the adminiſtration of the Goſpel in its ſimplicity; for the ſake of its
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172571:33"/>naked ſelf) might conſiſt with thoſe Publick ends which did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it; and Policy being the principle predominant in the firſt, hath ſtrugled againſt piety unto this laſt act, and is not yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered; and I preſume, the Scholars and Maſters of <hi>Oxford</hi> will not plead an immunity from policy, paſſion, and prejudice, when they are to paſs judgment againſt <hi>their credits, reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and estates;</hi> as in the caſe of this Covenant, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend they were to do; and that theſe prirciples will provoke us to yield our own, and exact from others an aſſent to things <hi>as agreeable to the Word of God,</hi> which in themſelves are <hi>vitious and corrupt,</hi> no ſerious man or Chriſtian can or will deny: It is wel if we find this Reaſon ſtated under a more cautious, vigilant, and pious frame of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But I muſt confeſs, I wonder not ſo much to hear theſe Gentlemen to profeſs <hi>They had by their perſonal ſubſcription ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church of</hi> England <hi>as agreeable to the Word of God;</hi> (which might be an act of raſhneſs, an effect of ignorance, an event of ſome diſtreſſed condition, or diſtemper of mind, fear of loſing, or hope of gaining preferment,) as to hear them ſay, That <hi>this was enjoyned by law to them, and all that were admitted to benefices:</hi> That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church was to be <hi>aſſented unto,</hi> I grant is by <hi>Law eſtabliſhed;</hi> but the aſſent to <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government,</hi> I obſerve, not to be enjoyned by any full and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Law: I find indeed, ſomething relating to Diſcipline <hi>in the ordering of Deacons and Prieſts, Biſhops and Archbiſhops,</hi> and <hi>the Churches power about traditions, and Rites, or Ceremonies,</hi> inſerted into the 39. Articles? but how, or by what Law they are eſtabliſhed,
<note place="margin">13. <hi>Eliz</hi> 12.</note> I know not: The Statute requiring Miniſters aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, doth not ſpecifie the Articles particulary; and the general Note whereby to know them laid down in the Statute, is this, <hi>Articles of Religion which ONLY concern the Confeſſion of the true Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine of the Sacraments:</hi> This particle ONLY, is, in my judgment, excluſive to Diſcipline and Government; and how theſe came into the Articles, I know not: only I find the <hi>Epistle</hi> to His late Majeſty, before the

                  <p n="5">5. Whether <hi>eſtabliſhed or exerciſed,</hi> I think it very ſtrange to ſee theſe learned men on ſerious thoughts to profeſs <hi>their own hearts did not condemn them, nor had their brethren convinced their judgements they had done amiſs, by their perſonal ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to approve the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of</hi> England <hi>to be agreeable to the Word of GOD, but that thereof they were still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, what effect had been wrought on their conſciences, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell: I will hope they were not <hi>ſeared,</hi> or ſhut up by a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>non-perſwaſion</hi> to the contrary; yet had I been amongſt them (with ſubmiſſion) I muſt have expoſtulated with them, and enquire,</p>
                  <p>Whether they had not ſubſcribed to the <hi>uſe of the Common Prayer, and form in the ſaid Book preſcribed in publick prayer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Enjoyned to be ſubſcribed by every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter before he be ordained, in Canons of 1603. Ca. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>and NONE OTHER.</hi> Did none of theſe Maſters publickly <hi>pray</hi> in St <hi>Maryes</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and other Churches, before and after their Sermons? Were not ſuch prayers <hi>publick prayer?</hi> Did they at ſuch times uſe the <hi>Common Prayer?</hi> If not, did not their conſciences mind them of their <hi>ſubſcribed promiſe</hi> ſolemnly made in entring on ſo holy a calling? Are not <hi>NONE OTHER,</hi> words as fully excluſive of their own forms extemporary or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate, as can be expreſſed? Admit we this <hi>Common Prayer</hi> to be lawful, yea neceſſary, is not this excluſive ſubſcription a plain limitation of the Spirit, rejection of the gift of prayer, and robbing the Church of Miniſterial parts unto prayer, as well as preaching to the edification thereof? Did Chriſt, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the moſt perfect prayer, tye his Diſciples to uſe that and <hi>None other?</hi> Can any rationally-religious man, ſubſcribe this promiſe, and approve it to be agreeable to the VVord of God,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:172571:34"/>and ſtand perſwaded it is not contrary thereunto?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Is it agreeable to the Word of God to affix a ſentence of mans conception and framing to divine ſervice, and denominate it <hi>a Sentence of Scripture?</hi> In the Rubrick of the Common Prayer, the Prieſt is appointed to read one of <hi>theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Scripture which follow:</hi> The very firſt of which is, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner repenteth him of his ſin from the bottom of his heart, I will put all his wickedneſſe out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſaith the Lord;</hi> the which is referred in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (as are the following ſentences to their places) unto <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21,
<note place="margin">As is Dr. <hi>Boyes</hi> in his Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. p. 1.</note> 22 (to ſay nothing of the effect, though accidental of this ſuppoſed Scripture) how many have been deceived, really belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to be a Sentence of Scripture, when it is not found in all the Bible? Methinks theſe men ſhould have obſerved how our late Maſters had corrected this groſs and obvious fault in the <hi>Scotch Liturgy,</hi> before they had thus confidently told the world, <hi>They were perſwaded there is nothing in the worſhip of</hi> England, <hi>which is not agreeable to the VVord of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the VVorſhip of <hi>England</hi> much of <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture is omitted,</hi> and never to be read (a fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the firſt Compilers of the Common-Prayer-Book) and much of the <hi>Ap crypha,</hi>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:172571:34"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, Will theſe Maſters and Scholars ſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the <hi>extraordinary Solemn Worſhip</hi> appointed by the Common-Prayer-Book <hi>unto holy dayes and their Eves,</hi> is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God, wherein every particular <hi>holy-day</hi> hath its diſtinct and particular <hi>Collects, Epiſtles, and Goſpels,</hi> as its Solemn Service appointed: not to inſiſt on the ſuppoſed influence of that reputed ſanctity on <hi>the Six or Seaven days following,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the ſame ſervice to be impertinently continued; as in the Feaſt of the <hi>Nativity, Eaſter, Whitſuntide, Aſcenſion,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; nor the <hi>unwaerrantable preheminence</hi> given to ſome parts of Scripture above others; or the irrational denomination of ſome Prophetical and Hiſtorical portions of Scripture <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> all which are well urged by many Non-conformiſts. I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what part of Sacred Writ ſtamps Sanctity on <hi>Wedneſday and Friday,</hi> more than the other four dayes of the week, and ſets them into a parity with <hi>Sunday</hi> (to retain their Dialect) that the ſame more Solemn ſervice ſhall be read on thoſe dayes, as on that day?

Is not a Religious owning, and obſervation of ſome time, as (not appointed by the God of our time, whoſe ſole Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it is to make it) Solemn and Holy time, to be Religiouſly employed, a plain and formal Superſtition repugnant to Goſpel-Rules? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.16. I am not ignorant that ſome holy-dayes have been of <hi>ancient and univerſal obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the Church, and have laid claim to <hi>Apoſtolical tradition,</hi> and occaſioned much controverſie in the Church; but I ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in their inſtitution: I deny not the juſt authority of the Church or Chriſtian Magiſtrate over our time; but I think there is a vaſt difference between time as the <hi>ſubject,</hi> and as the <hi>adjunct</hi> of Religion; God only can make it the firſt; humane authority may appoint <hi>holy Faſting, and holy Feasting</hi> (thoſe tranſient acts of Worſhip dependant on, and ſubſervient unto Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of providence to his people) and ſo may determine (the ſecond) time (like the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi>) as a neceſſary
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172571:35"/>adjunct to thoſe acts of Worſhip; but to make holy-dayes Subjects of Solemn, Sacred ſervice, I have not ſeen any Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that doth authorize the Church thereunto: Eminent Saints call for the eſteem of the Church, but the keeping of them in a Calendar, and appointing them their ſeveral holy-dayes, ſets them a pitch too high, and ſhews the Church partial, reſpecters of perſons, having ſome in admiration, and ſlighting others no leſs deſerving; or ſubjects here unto an intolerable burden, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating every day to be Holy: The Nativity; Circumciſſion, Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of our Lord and Saviour, are all myſteries or matters of reverence, eſteem, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Church, to be duly and diſtinctly conſidered; yet (under correction of better judgments) the ſeveral holy dayes appointed to the memorial of them, is in my thoughts no leſs ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational than irreligious: I ſay <hi>irrational;</hi> becauſe though ſome of them be <hi>great Myſteries,</hi> yet they are not ſimply and in themſelves <hi>mercies to the Church,</hi> but as they relate unto, and center in the work of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

God doth not mediately, what he doth immediately; or by Commiſſion, what is done in his own perſon I well know, ſome in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts for Holy-dayes</hi> make the <hi>Sabbath</hi> changeable at the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pleaſure; and if theſe ſeveral acts of Redemption be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated in their diſtinct holy-dayes, I ſee not how we can avoid a return to the Jews Sabbath; for the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand muſt needs be moral; and this method takes away the reaſon of the alteration of the day.

Or thoſe ſince preſſed; as, the <hi>Bowing at the Name of Jeſus: Turning Tables into Altars, and Bowing to them, and placing on them Candlesticks and Tapers: The Conſecration of Churches,</hi> and the like; though I ſhould (which I confeſs I cannot) admit what is pretended in the Preface to the Common-Prayer-Book, <hi>that they are apt to ſtirre up the dull mind of man to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his duty to God by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he might be edified;</hi> yet I muſt enquire by <hi>what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> are they appointed? the higheſt pretended is the <hi>Church;</hi> and I ſee no Commiſſion the Church hath to appoint ſuch things: If I miſtake not, the power of the Church is <hi>declarative, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Miniſterial,</hi> not <hi>judicial and magiſterial:</hi> She may publiſh the matter, and preſcribe the Order of Gods Worſhip; but not conſtitute or ordain new matter, <hi>though never ſo much tending to edification,</hi> againſt which ſhe is expreſly barr'd by the 2d.

                  <p>Seventhly, and Laſtly, Is it agreeable to the Word of God, <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to divide the work of the Miniſtry?</hi> and give authority to apply one of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and not the other? to baptize, but not adminiſter the Lords Supper otherwiſe than as Aſſiſtant to him who hath miniſterial power of conſecration, as it is done in the Ordering of Deacons? Again, is it agreeable to the Word, to denominate Goſpel Miniſters <hi>Prieſts</hi> (which properly relate to a Sacrifice and Altar?) If ſo, why did our late Maſters altar the Title into <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy? It is agreeable to the Word, that the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſwear,</hi> or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſe <hi>obedience unto their fellow Miniſters,</hi> under the notion of an ordinary and Cheif Miniſter? It is reaſon they keep order, and be ſubject to the Aſſembly; but parity of Office and Authority, admits not of obedience. Is it agreeable to the Word, that <hi>Biſhops ſweare,</hi> or Solemnly promiſe <hi>obedience unto the Archbiſhops?</hi> If ſo, why not Archbiſhops to Cardinals or Patriarchs, and they to the Pope? Is it becauſe the Sea bounds our Papacy? Is it in the forme of ordination agreeable to the Word, that the Biſhop ordaining, do Magiſterially repeat the words of Jeſus Chriſt who had a power and did effect it, <hi>(viz.) Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt; Whoſe ſins thou doſt forgive, they are forgiven, and whoſe ſins thou doſt retain, they are retained?</hi> as actually giving the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as a qualification for that Office, and after this to give authority of adminiſtration with a <hi>Take thou authority to preach the Word of God, and to minister the Holy Sacraments.</hi> Is it agreeable to the Word of God, by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, Solemn, and Religious act, to Conſecrate unto a degree convenient and only neceſſary for the method and Order of an Aſſembly? as if it were (and indeed however others think, by reaſon of the variation of the word, I believe it was intended to be) an actual Ordination to a diſtinct Office of Miniſtry in the Church, like the Cheif Prieſt-hood among the Jews? I am at a loſs in Civil or Religious Policy, to finde a warrant for ſo Sacred a forme in an advancement to a degree, yet I will not deny the formalities of the Chaire; Is it agreeable to the Word of God, that <hi>excommunication</hi> (the laſt and greateſt of Cenſures) do proceed without <hi>admonition?</hi> and be inflicted <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> before obſtinacy the proper and only ground of it be detected, much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172571:37"/>leſſe convicted? and that ſo dreadful a Cenſure be denounced on the non-obſervance of Rites and Ceremonies declared <hi>indifferent,</hi> and other light and frivolous occaſions? nay, on the very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty?

                  <p>Sir, theſe things, and ſuch like, in the <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government of the Church of England,</hi> are obvious; and have been often urged as needing Reformation; and as Reaſons Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing for the Non-ſubſcription of the Sober, Learned, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation, as by Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Cartwright,</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Devonſhire and Cornwal,</hi> the Miniſters within the Dioceſs of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and many others, whoſe Printed Books could not but have been ſeen by (at leaſt ſome of) the Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and might have convinced their judgments, that <hi>they had done amiſs by their perſonal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to approve that all things in the four specified particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, were agreeable to the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Their confidence that all things in theſe four ſpecified particulars, are agreeable to the Word of God, and need no Reformation, may well engage them to conclude, that they are <hi>much better than thoſe of</hi> Scotland, <hi>which they wear to ſwear to preſerve:</hi> For, the Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> differeth in all the particulars mentioned, and ſo muſt needs be diſſonant, if theſe be <hi>AGREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ABLE TO THE WORD OF GOD:</hi> Yet Sir, methinks the <hi>good grounds on which they thought ſo,</hi> might (for their clearer Apology, and ſatisfaction of other ſouls called to ſwear the ſame Covenant) have been ſpecified and declared; the rather, for that they ſeemed to be in a ſtrait when they pointed unto <hi>the account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Biſhops Antichriſtian, and indifferent Ceremonies unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the making their Diſcipline the mark of a true Church, and the ſetting up thereof the erecting of the Throne of Chriſt,</hi> as things tending towards Superſtition and Schiſme, and the worſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172571:38"/>things in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which called for Reformation, rather than Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Hazard of their eſtates</hi> doth ſeem indeed to be their great ſtumbling block in their way to the Covenant: <hi>All Clerks are by the Lawes yet in force, required to give their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto what by this Covenant is required to be reformed, and that on pain of loſing their Benefice:</hi> Which Sir, we ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (though it would admit a diſpute in reference to many, if not all the particulars mentioned;) yet how ſhould this demurre to the taking of the Covenant? Becauſe the Law requires <hi>our aſſent,</hi> it will not therefore follow, <hi>they need not reformation,</hi> nor it is not lawful for us to <hi>endeavour their reformation:</hi> Many men have <hi>aſsented to the Law,</hi> who could never give the <hi>aſſent requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Law;</hi> and by ſuffering, ſhewed that the Law is their burden, binding them to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> whilſt it requireth what they in truth and good Conſcience <hi>cannot yield:</hi> But muſt good men continue under this burden, and take no care to eaſe themſelves? Is it a ſin for men to covenant in their places to endeavour the removal of a burdenſom Law? Or might not the Reformation covenanted, be ſo endeavoured?</p>
                  <p>Nay Sir, on the conſideration of the whole Reaſon, can ſuch endeavour be any <hi>wrong to mens conſciences, reputation, or eſtate?</hi> and then there is no ſtrength in this 2d. Reaſon of <hi>Oxford</hi> againſt the covenanting ſuch an endeavour. But we proceed to their 3d. Reaſon of this Exception.</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon on which the Maſters,
<note place="margin">3d. Reaſon of this exception.</note> Scholars, &amp;c. of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſtand diſſatisfied concerning the Covenant, or Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>England</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is indeed the moſt weighty and conſiderable, if but clearly proved: and it is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their manifest danger of perjury; the Covenant in this point ſeeming directly contrary to the former Solemn Proteſtation:</hi> (I preſume they mean that of <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641.) <hi>which they had ſworn neither for hope or fear, or other reſpect ever to relinquiſh: or the Oath of Supremacy, which according to the Laws of this Realm, and the Statutes of this Univerſity, they had ſworn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this Reaſon I eaſily grant, that contradictory Oaths do run the ſoul on <hi>manifeſt perjury;</hi> and if the firſt were lawful, the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:172571:38"/>laſt muſt needs be ſinful, neither to be ſworn at firſt, nor obliging at laſt, if it be ſworn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the <hi>contradiction muſt be manifeſt</hi> and clear; not <hi>ſeeming,</hi> and conjectural, which may ſpring by paſſion and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, to the fancy of ſuch as are willing to ſuppoſe it, (as all things look yellow to Jaundies eyes) and is not in reality ſuch to impartial Readers. It ſeems this contradiction between this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and thoſe Oaths, was, to the men of <hi>Oxford.</hi> but <hi>ſeeming,</hi> though <hi>to their best underſtandings</hi> (in their then capacity I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) and it muſt paſs into a <hi>certainty,</hi> before it, diſcharge the bond to ſuch as are under it, though <hi>ſeeming ſo to be,</hi> might ſuſpend the act of them to whom it ſo ſeemed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But let us ſee wherein <hi>ſeems this contradiction:</hi> It is well if it amount not to as much as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Notions before ſpecified, which <hi>ſeemed to tend to Superſtition and Schiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then of the contradiction to their proteſtation, which I imagine can be no other but that of <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. and ſo far as it concernes Religion, runneth thus, <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almighty God, vow and proteſt to maintain and defend as farre as lawfully I may with my life, power, and eſtate, the true, Reformed, Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt all Popery, and Popiſh Innovations within this Realm, contrary to the ſame Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Solemn League and Covenant in the Article under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, runneth thus; <hi>That we ſhall ſincerely, really, and constantly, through the grace of God, endeavor, in our ſeveral places and callings, the Reformation of Religion in the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, according to the Word of God, and example of the beſt reformed Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contraria contrariis juxta oppoſita magis eluceſcunt.</hi> Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impartial eye reade theſe two Oaths thus oppoſed, and ſhew me wherein <hi>ſeeme</hi> the contradiction to lie: They may indeed <hi>ſeem</hi> different in their ſound and manner of expreſſion, but <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> well knoweth, that all <hi>diverſa,</hi> are not <hi>oppoſita,</hi> all <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> amounts not to a <hi>contradiction; diverſa &amp; oppoſita aeque diſſentanea ſunt, ſed non aeque diſſentiunt;</hi> they differ indeed, but not with the ſame difference: I wiſh that on ſecond thoughts they will pleaſe to tell us whether the difference be <hi>Re,</hi> or <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> only; the ſame thing being proteſted in the <hi>firſt</hi> (though not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172571:39"/>in the ſame words, and after the manner) which was covenanted in the <hi>laſt:</hi> But they ſpecifie the contradiction; <hi>(viz.) The Doctrine they vowed to maintain by the name of the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>they took to be the ſame now to be reformed and altered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, were they not, <hi>in taking it ſo to be,</hi> much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? The Covenant binds to Reforme Doctrine <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England;</hi> was there no ſuch Doctrine openly divulged in the <hi>Court Sermons and Printed books</hi> of <hi>Mountague, Reive, Heylen, Dowe, Cozens, Pocklington,</hi> and others before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned? In <hi>Mountague, Apello ad Caeſarem: originum Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticorum,</hi> 2 parts: <hi>Anti-diatribae: Pocklingtons Sunday no Sabbath; Altare Christianum: Heylens Coal from the Altar; Hiſtory of the Sabbath: Sales</hi> his <hi>introduction to a devout life: Shelfords five Treatiſes: Dowe againſt Mr. Burton: Cozens</hi> his <hi>houres of Prayer:</hi> and many other licenſed books publickly ſold in the Kingdom; and in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitation Articles</hi> of Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Peirce,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> (on which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good men were vexed;) which was diſtinct, and different, (if I may not ſay) expreſly contrary to the Proteſtant Religion expreſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And did not theſe need Reformation? And is it not the duty of every good Subject and Proteſtant in maintenance of this Religion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor a <hi>Reformation,</hi> alteration, and total expunction of ſuch Doctrine, and ſo to Covenant? And then Sir, where is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? In this ſenſe the Proteſtation and Covenant do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>coincidere,</hi> and agree in one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, let us allow them their ſence, That <hi>the Doctrine proteſted to be maintained, is the ſame covenanted to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> Are Maintenance and Reformation incompetible? is there not a poſſbility of ſome adjuncts unto the ſubſtance of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſſing the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, and ſeperable without the deſtruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Or may not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as to the ſcant, general, dubious, and difficult manner of expreſſion, and yet the matter thereof be maintained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended? Are thoſe Articles which concern the Government of the Church, and Conſecration of the Biſhops and Archbiſhops, of the eſſence and formality of the true Reformed, Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:172571:39"/>Will not the aſſertion thereof tend more to Schiſm, than <hi>Scotlands</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>making their Diſcipline and Government the mark of a true Church?</hi> As denying the Reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea to have attained to the true Reformed, Proteſtant Religion, which yet they handed over to us?</p>
                  <p>But what reaſon had theſe Gentlemen of <hi>Oxford</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in ſuch a latitude? when the ſence of it is limited by them who were then known to be <hi>Legiſlators</hi> (and a power ſufficient to preſcribe an Oath, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which themſelves ſubjected) and were the beſt expoſitors thereof <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Houſe of Commons who thus declared:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas ſome doubts have been raiſed concerning the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words [The true Reformed, Protestant Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>againſt all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Popiſh innovations within this Realm contrary to the ſame Doctrine] This Houſe doth declare, that by theſe words, was, and is meant only the publick Doctrine profeſsed in the ſaid Church, ſo far as it is oppoſite to Popery and Popiſh innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And that the ſaid words are not to be extended to the maintaining of any form of Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government, nor of any the Rites and Ceremonies of the ſaid Church of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>By which theſe Gentlemen might have underſtood,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Realm, and Church of <hi>England,</hi> were two different Subjects; the one profeſſing Doctrine in the other, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there was Doctrine <hi>tending to Popery and Popiſh Innovation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There were in the Doctrines profeſſed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſome adjuncts of <hi>Rites, Ceremonies, Government, or ſome ſpecial order of Worſhip,</hi> which might need Reformation, and were not view'd to be maintained.</p>
                  <p>So that according to this ſence of them who preſcribed both, there is more of conſiſtency, than contradiction between the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation and Solemn League and Covenant:</hi> So that the manifeſt perjury they feared, hath not ſo much as a ſeeming ground.</p>
                  <p>And as for the ſuppoſed contradiction of this Branch of the Covenant unto the Oath of Supremacy, it will on examination va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh as an apparition, <hi>a thing which ſo ſeemed,</hi> but cannot be ſo proved: For if they will not hiſs me out of their Schools, I will grant them <hi>their Propoſition in the Oath,</hi> and <hi>aſſumption in the Statute</hi> by them quoted; and yet find a way to avoid <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:172571:40"/>becauſe a meer <hi>non ſequitur</hi> on their premiſes; and this, if they will have the Argument logically reſolved, by denying the <hi>conſequence</hi> of their major Propoſition; for I will grant unto them, that the Oath of Supremacy doth bind us to our power, <hi>to aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences, and Authorities, granted and belonging to the Kings Highneſs, his heirs and ſucceſſors, or united and annexed unto the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of this Realm:</hi> And aſſume with them, <hi>That the King had the whole power and Authority for Reformation, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Correction, of all manner of Errors, Hereſies, Schiſms, &amp;c.</hi> and yet deny the ſequel, <hi>viz. That we may not endeavour in our places and callings to reform Religion.</hi> For the defence of the Kings power is no way repugnant with the duty of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular capacity. I hope a Miniſter may by his preaching, or a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by his diſputation in the Schools, endeavour the correction and Reformation of Error and Hereſie, Schiſm or Superſtition, and yet not intrench on his Majeſties Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and ſo interfer with their Oath of Supremacy?

                  <p>Yet Sir, if I were to diſpute with a ſingle (though Senior) Sophiſter of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I would deny both Propoſitions; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, as to its ſequel or conſequence, as before; and the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that which the Statute doth not prove, <hi>viz. The whole power of Spiritual or Eccleſiastical Juriſdiction for Correction and Reformation, is annexed to the King, and Imperial Crown of this Realm:</hi> For the power by that Statute, is <hi>ſpecial</hi> and particular, not general and univerſal; as themſelves have cited it, is, <hi>(viz.)</hi> ſuch <hi>Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Superiorities, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences, Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical, as by any,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>But, Sir, Had not <hi>Oxford</hi> their numbers in Parliament? and did they not truſt them with their underſtandings? or muſt a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament offer Reaſons of the neceſſity and expediency of every Act they impoſe on the Subject, before the Subject yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? and yet the Vote of the Houſe of Commons paſt the 10th. of <hi>June,</hi> 1641. viz. <hi>That this Government hath been found by long experience to be a great impediment to the perfect reformation and growth of Religion, and very prejudicial to the Civil State;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the learned Speeches of many Members in the Houſe, printed; to offer Reaſon without, as well as within doors, might have laid ſomething before the judgments of theſe Gentlemen. I preſume, Sir, the Subjects obedience muſt not (in the judgment of this Univerſity) be ſuſpended untill the Reaſons of State producing the reſolution be known to, and and apprehended by every perſon and ſociety.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or at leaſt that Epiſcopal Aristocracy may lay a more just title and claim to a Divine Inſtitution, than Papal Monarchy, Presbyterial Democracy, and Independants by particular

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We are aſſured by the undoubted teſtimony of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Records, and later Hiſtory, that this Form of Government hath been continued with ſuch an univerſal, uninterrupted, unqueſtioned ſucceſſion in all the Churches, and in all Kingdoms that have been called Chriſtian, for fifteen hundred years together; that there never was in all that time any conſiderable oppoſition againſt it; that of Aerius was the greateſt, which grew from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and gain'd him the reputation of an Heretick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From which antiquity to depart, they fear by this extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give advantage to the Papiſts by contempt of antiquity; and ſhould diminiſh the Authority due to the conſentient judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of the univerſal Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, this is a very fair and ſpecious exception; for <hi>Divine Inſtitution, and ancient univerſal practice are very ſtrong bars againſt any Oath;</hi> and ſtrong conjecture of the one, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain aſſurance of the other, do forcibly ſuperſede any mans acting to the contrary; yet Sir,</p>
                  <p>I wonder that theſe learned men do but <hi>think of a Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and yet <hi>are aſſured of ancient univerſal practice, uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted for fifteen hundred year;</hi> methinks the laſt ſhould rather have remained doubtful; for conſcience can only be ſatisfied in the certainty of the former: <hi>A think ſo</hi> in a Divine Warrant, is both ſinful and dangerous; and I <hi>think</hi> the univerſal uniter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted practice of the Church for fifteen hundred years might well run back unto the times of our Lord and Saviour, and at leaſt the Acts of his Apoſtles; and the Sacred, as well as Eccleſiaſtical Story, might make mention of this Government, and ſo create an undeniable certainty; for the one, is a very uncertain ground of aſſurance without the other: But ſtay Sir, I forgot the year in which theſe learned men wrote, it was 1647. and ſo indeed one hundred and forty years might return before <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> appeared in the World; and yet they may by <hi>antient Records, and later Hiſtories,</hi> find the practice of it fifteen hundred years; but this will more weaken, than ſtrengthen the <hi>Divine Right;</hi> for without doubt, the moſt primitive and pure eſtate of the Church was in the firſt one hundred and forty years.</p>

They well know Epiſcopal Government may deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Government <hi>Communi Concilio Presbyterorum,</hi> by all Miniſters in the Church, who are the very true undoubted <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Biſhops;</hi> unto which, or whom there may be <hi>ordinis cauſa,</hi> for method ſake, a <hi>Superintendent</hi> Moderator or Chair-man; and this Epiſcopal Government is undoubtedly of <hi>Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and antient practice,</hi> preſcribed by the Holy Ghoſt, and propounded in the ſacred ſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> Chap. 20.28. where, as in other Scriptures, <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters</hi> are terms ſynonimous, denominating perſons inveſted with the <hi>ſame Office and Authority,</hi> and enjoying the ſame <hi>qualifications,</hi> and by common conſent <hi>ruling the Church of Chriſt;</hi> and then, Sir, we muſt tell them this is not to be endeavoured to be extirpated, nor doth the Covenant ſo propound it; which if it do, I conſent to reject it.</p>
                  <p>But if by <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> they mean that ſpecial Form and Frame of Government wherein one perſon is <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a diſtinct order of Miniſtry</hi> above other Miniſters, and is inveſted with <hi>Prince-like power</hi> over them, enjoying an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>peculiar to him,</hi> eonomine, <hi>as Biſhop,</hi> of ſole Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Juriſdiction, unto whom all other his Fellow-Miniſters are <hi>Subjects,</hi> and muſt ſwear to him obedience, who muſt have a Council denominated, <hi>Deans, Deacons, Prebends, Chapters,</hi> and the like, over and among whom he ſits as <hi>Lord;</hi> and yet over him acknowledgeth a <hi>more ſuperiour order</hi> under the title of <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> to whom he oweth and ſweareth <hi>obedience;</hi> and in this ſuperiour order, and lordly manner, he <hi>ruleth</hi> all Paſtours, and People, ſomtimes by <hi>himſelf,</hi> ſomtimes by his <hi>Chancellor</hi> or <hi>Comiſſary,</hi> his Surrogates, <hi>Deans, and Arch-deacons,</hi> with all

And then, Sir, I muſt deny, not that they <hi>think</hi> (for I muſt believe the profeſſion of <hi>their thought,</hi> though I think it ſtrange) but that there is any good ground for ſuch <hi>thoughts:</hi> and the opinion of an Univerſity, will not without good demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in this point, beget ſuch <hi>thoughts</hi> in me, <hi>That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by vertue of their ordinary power and authority derived from Chriſt, and deputed Governours of his Church, did ever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this Epiſcopal Government;</hi> or that it was <hi>according to the mind, and after the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who himſelf</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſe <hi>a Pompous and Princely power</hi> over his Diſciples; but converſed with them as his <hi>Peers and Equals;</hi> and gave them in charge that they ſhould not affect <hi>Superiority one over another, or Princely power over Gods Heritage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt put theſe Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to prove by plain and pregnant Scripture, That <hi>the Office of the Miniſtry may in Ordination be divided,</hi> and only ſome part of it be thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſo as that the Deacons may preach and baptize, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>That there are <hi>more orders of the Miniſtry than one,</hi> the Biſhop or Presbyter, or more Officers in the Church, than Elders and Deacons, appointed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles by their Apoſtolical Authority, who have only deſcribed their qualification, and directed the Ordination of theſe two, and no more. That the Presbyter (in whom is required the <hi>ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification;</hi> to whom is to be yielded the <hi>ſame obedience, ſubjection and respest;</hi> who receiveth the <hi>ſame Ordination,</hi> and is charged with the <hi>ſame duty,</hi> and inveſted with the <hi>ſame power of feeding and governing the Church of God,</hi> with the Biſhop, and none other) <hi>is an order diſtinct from and ſubject to the Biſhop,</hi> ſo to be ruled by him, and not to exerciſe his Office, but by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Licenſe,</hi> and at his pleaſure; and that the Presbyter is bound to ſwear obedience to the Biſhop as <hi>his Ordinary.</hi>

                  <p>But it may be, Sir, I run too faſt; methinks their <hi>think ſo</hi> of Divine Right and Apoſtolical eſtabliſhment, is aſſerted very faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore it is reſtrained and limited with <hi>an Epiſcopal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracy, hath a fairer pretenſion, and may lay a juſter title and claim to a Divine Inſtitution, than Papal Monarchy, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Democracy or Independent:</hi> Yet I muſt ſay, fair pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and comparative claims are very weak props againſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Reſolves, and the power of an Oath; it muſt be plain and undeniable Divine Right muſt ſtand againſt them.</p>

                  <p>Their <hi>think ſo</hi> of Divine Right turns into <hi>an aſſurance of univerſal uninterrupted ſucceſſion of this Form of Government in all Kingdoms that have been called Chriſtian, for fifteen hundred years together, without any conſiderable oppoſition, ſave that of</hi> Aerius, <hi>which ſprang from diſcontent, and gain'd him the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Heretick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is, Sir, the old, only, and uſual guard of Prelacy; I will not deny Antiquity its due Reverence, though I put not on it,

                  <p>It is well if their <hi>certain aſſurance</hi> in matter of Fact, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better bottomed, than their <hi>think ſo,</hi> in point of Divine Right. I know not what might be their <hi>undoubted teſtimony of ancient Records, and later Hiſtories,</hi> for they mention none; and therein their faith muſt be unto themſelves; but by ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or Modern Hiſtories as I have obſerved, it is very difficult to find this Form of Government (which muſt relate unto that to be extirpated by the Covenant, or elſe it is vain) to have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>univerſal, or uninterrupted in all Kingdoms that have been called Chriſtian,</hi> for half fifteen hundred years; for if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count backward from the time of their writing, they will find a violent interruption, and indeed extirpation of this Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by <hi>Chriſtian the King of Denmark,</hi> in the year 1537. as <hi>contrary to Chriſt his Inſtitution;</hi> and then they will loſe more then one of their fifteen hundred <hi>years without interruption,</hi> and that <hi>in a Kingdom called Chriſtian;</hi> and this Sir was to ſenſe, whatever it was to reaſon, <hi>a more conſiderable oppoſition than that of Aerius;</hi> not to mention the <hi>interruptions and extirpation in Scotland;</hi> which I preſume may be to them of little weight, that people in their eye ſcarce appearing <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:172571:52"/>unto the <hi>Declaration of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> is not to me ſo viſible; theſe Gentlemen refer us unto the Remonſtrance of <hi>December</hi> the fifth, 1641. and tell us, That <hi>the Houſe of Commons Remonſtrated, that it was far from their purpoſe or deſire, to aboliſh the Church-government, but rather that all the Members of the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſhould be regulated by ſuch Rules of Order and Diſcipline, as are eſtabliſhed by Parliament:</hi> Which words, by the variation of the character I imagined, to be the words of the Remonſtrance, but on ſearch, and ſecond reading of the Remonſtrance, I find no ſuch ſentence in the ſame; ſome parts of the ſentence in the Remonſtrance, themſelves have tranſcribed in the Margin, and it is this, <hi>They infuſe into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we mean to aboliſh all Church-government;</hi> which Text will not juſtifie or allow their inference; for it proclaims not the <hi>Parliaments purpoſe,</hi> but Malignants <hi>policy;</hi> not that it was far from their purpoſe or deſire <hi>to extirpate this kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but that the malice of their enemies did infuſe they would <hi>aboliſh all Government:</hi> Surely Sir, prejudice was very prevalent in theſe learned men of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which made them read inſtead of a complaint of grievance, <hi>a Declaration of purpoſe;</hi> and from the complaints of a general charge, to intend to <hi>aboliſh all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> to infer <hi>a purpoſe of preſervation</hi> of this ſpecifical Government, as if all Government were included in it; had they pleaſed to have read the whole ſentence, they would have ſeen that the words were much more general, <hi>aboliſh all Government, and leave every man to his own fancy, for the ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God;</hi> which they might not do, and yet <hi>extirpate the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,</hi> and late Epiſcopal Government of <hi>England;</hi> no marvel that this miſtake makes them imagine, and inſert into the Reaſon, <hi>a rather that all the Members ſhould be regulated, &amp;c.</hi> which deſire is not therein expreſſed, but only a profeſſion of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>That His Majeſty was under God entruſted with the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Law, to regulate all the Members of the Church of</hi> England <hi>by ſuch Rules of Order and Diſcipline, as are eſtabliſhed by Parliament:</hi> I think Sir, a profeſſion of his Majeſties <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> is vaſtly different from <hi>a Parliamentary proportioning</hi> of the Prelates <hi>preheminence;</hi> and the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi> may be acknowledged, when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are degraded, and ſet among their proper Peers: And now Sir, this <hi>repugnancy</hi> between the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:172571:52"/>Covenanted extirpation, and Parliaments purpoſe of perpetuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appeareth a <hi>think ſo,</hi> of like nature with the <hi>Apoſtolical Inſtitution</hi> of this Epiſcopacy; and it would be enquired whether it be more <hi>malignity</hi> to ſuggeſt to the people <hi>a purpoſe</hi> in the Parliament <hi>by them</hi> never declared, and ſo make them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the charge of <hi>ſelf-contradiction,</hi> or infuſe into the people the verity and plainneſs of their meaning, not to <hi>aboliſh all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but <hi>to extirpate this kind,</hi> which through the whole Remonſtrance they had declared to be ſo oppreſſive and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; if they will evade the <hi>influence, compaſs and danger</hi> of the fourth Article of this Covenant <hi>in the firſt caſe,</hi> I dare ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from it in reference to the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the main thing which concerneth the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is her foundation; which if <hi>it be removed, what ſhall the Righteous do?</hi> And theſe ſerious Caſuiſts do tell us, That <hi>the holy Church of</hi> England <hi>was founded in the ſtate of Prelacy, within the Realm of</hi> England, and they proved it by the Law; (for Goſpel without doubt they had none to prove it, that laying the <hi>Prophets and Apoſtles for the foundation, and Chriſt (an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Prelacy) the corner ſtone</hi>) and in their Margin they cite the Statute of <hi>Carlile,</hi> 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, their care of the <hi>Church, and its foundation</hi> is commendable; but how comes it to paſs that this Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt be made <hi>the foundation of the Church,</hi> without any danger of Schiſm by them, to whom <hi>Scotlands</hi> making <hi>their Diſcipline and Government the mark of a true Church, did</hi> ſeem <hi>ſo much tending to Schiſm?</hi> Muſt the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be a fundamental point of Religion, the very <hi>eſſe</hi> of the Church? and may not <hi>Scotland</hi> make her Government a note of diſtinction? <hi>Turpe eſt doctori, &amp;c.</hi> Sir, we cannot deny the proofs cited, and declaring <hi>the holy Church of</hi> England <hi>to be founded in the eſtate of Prelacy;</hi> but I cannot but ſtand amazed to find men making Apologies, propounding doubts, profeſſing a ſerious deſire to have conſcience ſatisfied; ſo much to content themſelves, and cozen their Readers with plain fallacies; ſuch Sophiſme as better beſeems the <hi>Logick,</hi> than <hi>Divinity</hi> Schools;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:172571:53"/>and common <hi>Halls,</hi> than the <hi>Regent houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things are to be explained. What they mean by <hi>holy Church?</hi> and what <hi>foundation</hi> this is, to which the Statutes relate?</p>
                  <p>Theſe learned men wel know, that by <hi>holy Church,</hi> in the acceptation of that Age, and of thoſe very <hi>Acts,</hi> the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt at <hi>Carlile,</hi> and the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, was meant the Pompous, Popiſh Eccleſiaſtical State, whereof Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies and Priories were no ſmall Members, as in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other Grants of Kings, which had then ſuch influence on the Civil State, as that no Act of Parliament could bind, or be deemed valid, without the <hi>ratifying cenſure of holy Church,</hi> whoſe manner was by her authority, to curſe all that ſhould not keep ſuch Lawes as were agreed; I wiſh the Maſters and Scholars would ſpeak out, and tell us, whether they think they are bound to uphold this <hi>holy Church?</hi> or that the Church of Chriſt may not, yea, do not ſubſiſt in <hi>England,</hi> now <hi>holy Church</hi> is driven out; the Church ſimply Chriſtian, is very different from the <hi>pompous popiſh, holy Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again Sir, the <hi>foundation</hi> mentioned in theſe Statutes, is ſutable to the Fabrick,

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:172571:53"/>after the Law of</hi> England; ſo that this <hi>Prelacy</hi> is purely Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and the <hi>foundation</hi> more profitable than pious; could theſe learned men be ſo abſurd, as to make the very being of the Church to ſtand on ſuch a <hi>foundation?</hi> were there not Churches of Chriſt before Patrons, Poſſeſſons and Preſentations? and may they not be when theſe large endowments are taken away from the places to which they are affixed? <hi>This Prelacy</hi> will determine <hi>the Church of England</hi> by the fall of Monaſteries to have been <hi>ſhaken in the foundation;</hi> and by vertue of this <hi>Political Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have given the poſſeſſions of Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks to their Chancellours, Treaſurers, Secretaries, Kinſmen, meer Lay-perſons for increaſe of their means,

                  <p>Having found ſo little weight in what is urged <hi>from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> by Epiſcopacy, of the <hi>eſtate of the Church of</hi> England, we ſhall not expect much in what is incumbent upon themſelves, againſt their <hi>Covenanting to endeavour to extirpate this kind of Government;</hi> yet that little we ſhall conſider, and it relates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their perſonal capacities in their third exception, or more publick Obigations in their fifth exception.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>Vnto all which I ſhall ſay very briefly:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is worth their enquity, whether they ſubſcribed the 39. Articles <hi>judiciouſly and judicially,</hi> and ſo gave their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Government; we grant, that in the 39. Articles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly publiſhed, there is one <hi>(viz.)</hi> the 36. which relateth to <hi>the Book of Conſecration of Biſhops and Arch-biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> But that it affirmeth <hi>that Book to contain in it nothing contrary to the Word of God;</hi> I find not, in either the Latine or Engliſh Copy of theſe Articles which I have ſeen; theſe learned men ſure read theſe <hi>Articles</hi> with the Parliaments <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſo miſread them both; but ſuppoſe the Article had ſo <hi>affirmed;</hi> it had laid no bar to the <hi>alteration, or extirpation of this Government;</hi> for it might be (as indeed all our Stattues do ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt) a meer Political, Civil conſtitution, and ſo (though an <hi>Adiaphoron</hi>) <hi>not contrary</hi> any more than <hi>conſonant</hi> to the Word of God, and alterable at the pleaſure of <hi>Englands</hi> Parliaments: and then Sir with whatever judgment theſe Gentlemen ſubſcribed this Article, I am ſure there is not much in pleading it as a Bar to the duty enjoyned by Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt confeſs I am not ſatisfied that the <hi>Books of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Prieſts and Deacons, and Conſecration of Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,</hi> did contain in them nothing contrary to the Word of God;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172571:54"/>for I not believe, nor <hi>is it evident to me by Holy Scripture, or ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles times there hath been theſe orders of Miniſters in Chriſts Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons;</hi> for I find no <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the new Teſtament; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Presbyters and Biſhops</hi> to be no more than different denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the ſame order; and make not different orders any more than Paſtours, Teachers, Stewards, Angels, Stars, and the like; and if there were theſe orders, yet it is I think contrary to the Word of God, to add a fourth, <hi>Arch-biſhops;</hi> and if they be not an order, how come they to have the ſame conſecration with Biſhops (a contended for order of the Miniſtry) and how come Biſhops <hi>to ſwear unto them obedience?</hi> neither the one, nor the other is common to a <hi>gradual preheminence;</hi> the Speaker of the Parliament, or Lord Chief Juſtice, hath no ſuch like Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion whether the word will allow an Ordination <hi>to ſome part of the Miniſtry,</hi> and give Authority to <hi>apply one Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Seal of the Covenant, and not the other;</hi> nor am I clear the <hi>Deacons Office</hi> doth at all conſiſt in Miniſtry of Word and Baptiſm; and aſſiſtance at the Communion, the Scripture ſpecially points them to the poor, and to ſerve Tables.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion whether <hi>mute ſervice in a publick ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly be not contrary to the Word of God;</hi> where all, as well prayer as preaching ought to tend to Edification.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion whether a Magiſterial and Authoritative <hi>giving the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (peculiar to Chriſt, who did it in reality) be not contrary to the Word of God? or according to the words of the Article, <hi>Superſtitious and ungodly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whether Miniſters ſwearing <hi>Caronical obedience</hi> to the Biſhop, or Biſhops to the <hi>Arch-biſhops,</hi> be not plainly Papal and ungodly?</p>
                  <p>If theſe learned men conſidered, and were convinced of the conſonancy of theſe, and the like things with the Word, I hope they ſubſcribed this Article <hi>judiciouſly?</hi> yet I muſt enquire how <hi>judicially?</hi> I imagine the Satute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> will nos be produced as their warrant for ſubſcription to this Article; for the <hi>Articles</hi> thereby enjoyned,
<note place="margin">13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13.</note> 
                     <hi>do only concern the confeſſion of the true Chriſtian Faith, and Doctrine of the Sacraments;</hi> and this particle <hi>only;</hi> is excluſive to <hi>Diſcipline and Government,</hi> which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172571:55"/>by the whole current of our Laws are concluded to be Political in their nature, &amp; only Eccleſiaſtical <hi>ratione objecti,</hi> &amp; at the pleaſure of the Magiſtrate; and therefore could not be made an Article of the <hi>true Chriſtian Faith;</hi> I hope ſuch as leave this Article out of their Creed, ſhall not be ſhut out of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir; were there any force in this exception to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I would adviſe that ſubſcription to be taken into ſecond thoughts; yet it is as ponderous as the next.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That they ſhould <hi>root them up who had laid their hands on them,</hi> was not required; they might continue <hi>Men, Miniſters;</hi> it is like <hi>better Chriſtians, and more painful Preachers,</hi> when they were not <hi>Biſhops;</hi> I hope <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi> were not inſeparable; that the one muſt be ruined in the removal of the other; and our queſtion is of the thing, not perſon; in which <hi>degradation</hi> was the worſt they could do them; who had they been affected with the dream of <hi>Richard Havering Arch-biſhop of Dublin,</hi>

Or when the Parliament do ſee good by their Votes, Reſolves, Orders, or impoſed Oaths, to alter or extirpate the Government which the King was empowred to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute and adminiſter; His Supremacy being <hi>purely executive,</hi> and that ſubject to the <hi>Legiſlation of Parliament;</hi> upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Peoples Oath of <hi>maintaining the Honour, Eſtate, and Juriſdiction of the King,</hi> may be voided as to this and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mode and thing; and yet the <hi>Parliament not take upon them to abſolve the People from that obedience they owe under God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King;</hi> nor is the limitation of the exerciſe of <hi>Supremacy,</hi>

                  <p>And on theſe Conſiderations let it be obſerved that the Kings Coronation Oath <hi>to grant, keep, and confirm the Laws, Cuſtomes, and Franchiſes granted to the Clergy, by the glorious King Saint</hi> Edward; <hi>and preſerve to the Biſhops their Churches all Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal priviledges, &amp;c.</hi> which theſe learned men do cite, is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> which the People in Parliament aſſembled ſhall chooſe; according to which the King is bound to Rule; for otherwiſe this Coronation Oath will not only bind the <hi>perpetuation</hi> of this Government by <hi>Prelacy;</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> of the Abbies and Monaſteries demoliſhed, and the <hi>Popes Supremacy expelled;</hi> all which were granted to the Clergy by the glorious King St. <hi>Edward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But admit we theſe learned men the ſenſe they ſeem to put upon the Kings Supremacy; methinks the modeſt expreſſions of the Covenant might have anticipated this exception, it only binding us <hi>within our places and callings</hi> (which might be by <hi>humble advice and ſupplication to the King,</hi> by vertue of His Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority to effect it) <hi>to endeavour the extirpation of this Prelacy; that is, the Government by Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Deans and Chapters,</hi> and the like; but ſuch was their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it, that they <hi>could not deſire;</hi> nay, they could not but <hi>beg of God that he would not ſuffer the King to aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> which affection we muſt not think to abate, untill their judgements be better inform'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the <hi>benefit which did redound to the Crown by the Collation of Biſhopricks and Deanaries, by their first fruits, and yearly tenths, and profits in vacancies,</hi> though ſome queſtion the Kings propriety, not in reſpect of the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> but of the <hi>Law of God;</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt on that; only ſay, That the conſtant enjoyment of the full poſſeſſions of them, will make a <hi>much greater revenue,</hi> and maintain to the King <hi>a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſtate,</hi> than the <hi>firſt fruits, tenths and profits of vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> although ſuch vacancies as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Argument continued for the ſpace of 5, 10, 15, 20. or ſometimes thirty years together, taking the profits to themſelves, or beſtowing them on their attendants; and undoubtedly there is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:172571:57"/>the ſame capacity to <hi>extirpate the whole Government,</hi> as ſome Epiſcopal Seas; and to enlarge the Revenues of the Crown by the <hi>Reverſion of all the profits of the Government,</hi> and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment thereof, as to continue ſo long vacancies; moreover, I would deſire to know what is in this Argument more prevalent for Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and their Cathedral Churches, than for Abbots and Priors their Monaſteries and houſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to <hi>the agreeableneſs of this Government in the Church to the Civil conſtitution of the Kingdom;</hi> I only ſay that I queſtion whether the Lord Chriſt, who declared <hi>his Kingdom not to be of this World,</hi> will allow, or do appoint the Governments of the World to be the ſquare of Government in his Church; and I confeſs I can hardly reconcile it to his <hi>Regal Power, and Faithful Adminiſtration in his Houſe;</hi> and I muſt have a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Text than I have yet met withall, if it be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in theſe terms: <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them, and they are great, and exerciſe authority up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your M niſter; and whoſoever will be Chief among you, let him be your ſervant,</hi> Matth. 20.25.29, 27. Mark 10.42, 43, 44. Luke 22.23, 24. The ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> write himſelf <hi>Servus Servorum Dei; Whitehead,</hi> and others, refuſe, <hi>Coverdalle,</hi> and many others decline their Biſhopricks, as having in them <hi>aliquid commune eum Antichristo;</hi> I think the Clown his queſtion to the Biſhop of <hi>Cullen,</hi> were worth conſidering, <hi>What will become of the Biſhops, when the Dukes be damned?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>agreeableneſs</hi> of Prelacy with <hi>Englands ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath not been ſo obvious to others, as theſe Gentlemen ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the vigilant eye, and ſtrong hand, wherewith in all Ages it hath been reſtrained; theſe <hi>Petrae,</hi> and <hi>Rupes Wincheſter</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. were judged <hi>very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> when they conſtrained a Covenant <hi>without and againſt the Kings conſent,</hi> to remove them as evil Counſellours. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris</hi> our old Hiſtorian, <q rend="inline">notes Biſhops to have ever been the <hi>Make-bates between the King and People,</hi> ſcrewing up the Kings Prerogative beyond thee onſtitutions of the Kingdom, and liberties, yea, ſafety of the Subjects; and chargeth all the Wars, Broiles, Miſchiefs and Evils of the Barons Wars, to have

                  <p>The <hi>premuniries</hi> by which they have ever been awed, and their late High <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> authorizing them to act <hi>any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, provocation, priviledge, exemption, proclamation, law, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, whatſoever notwithſtanding;</hi> and their <hi>bold Uſurpation</hi> in their own name and authorities, and under their own ſeals to iſſue forth Proceſs, Excommunications, Cenſures, and other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their <hi>Imperial Canons</hi> in 1640. do beſpeak them <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Civil Government and Conſtitution of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and I think a private ſociety ſhould with very much of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty affirm the agreeableneſs of this Government, after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on mature deliberation and debate, as moſt proper Judges,
<note place="margin">Vote of the 10th of <hi>June</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, as to the ſo often Canted Aphoriſme of King <hi>James, No Biſhop, No King;</hi> with which the Prelates and their Prieſts do too much ſtrive to rivet their Government unto the Crown; I muſt be free to ſay, that it is more <hi>politick than pious</hi> and of no more warrant or authority, than the <hi>Spaniards one u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Emperour, and one Pope, or univerſal Biſhop;</hi> and when the <hi>Scots loyal adherence to,</hi> and advancement of His moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, unto the Ruine of their Kingdom, Loſs of their lives and Eſtates, Exile and Impriſonment of their Nobles, and Conqueſt of their Land; together with the <hi>unceſſant ſtruglings</hi> of the Covenant Intereſt, under Sequeſtration, Impriſonments, Baniſhments, and death of many; not ceaſing till they had (by Gods bleſſing) effected the Happy and Honourable Reſtitution of King and Kingdom, be well conſidered, I hope theſe learned Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Oxford</hi> will ſee ſome proceedings that may at leaſt <hi>weaken their belief</hi> in this political Maxime.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen, Sir, the ſtrength of theſe learned exceptions unto the <hi>ſecond Article of the Covenant,</hi> the great eye-ſore of our Age; and find little or nothing therein, to charge the matter thereof <hi>with falſhood or injuſtice?</hi> but that notwithſtanding the grudging of proud and profane men, it ſtands in this reſpect <hi>eſtabliſhed;</hi> they have herein been long, and conſtrained me to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:172571:58"/>ſtay too long in conſideration of what they urge: but as they, ſo I ſhall be more brief and contracted in their following excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they ſuggeſt many to be <hi>great</hi> ones, but profeſs to take up with <hi>few,</hi> which we muſt needs imagine not to be of the leaſt weight.</p>
                  <p>Unto the third Article they except nothing as to the matter of the promiſe,

                  <hi>Featlies</hi> ghoſt in the <hi>League Illegal,</hi> like ſome helliſh fury, repreſenting the Dr. to have been a man ſo haughtily devoted to the puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's of order and honour, as <hi>not to brook, or keep his hands from tearing a Liſt, Catalogue or Regiſter wherein they who were below him, ſhould be ranked above, and named before him;</hi> in ſenſe whereof he thus breaths againſt the Covenant; <hi>Not to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the prepoſterous order in ſetting down the parts of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein he that runneth, may read a double Soleciſm; for in it the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>precedeth the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and the Liberty of the Subject is ſet before the Royal Prerogative, and Imperial Dignity of the Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, admit we this; Is it not an high crime? and beſpeaks it not a ſober ſerious ſpirit in Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> a Member of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines (who by a motion might have had this order inverted, as eaſily as he obtained to have <hi>Prelacy</hi> ſpecified in the ſecond Article of the Covenant after it was paſt) to pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in the order of the words? although we deny not, That <hi>ſuch a ſacred and venerable evidence of fidelity is the Covenant, that matter, manner, phraſe and order ought to have</hi> (as I preſume they were) <hi>been maturely adviſed;</hi> yea, I wiſh <hi>line and period, word and ſyllable</hi> (which might be the Printers <hi>Errata</hi>) had been ſo ſcanned, that a captious <hi>Momus</hi> might not find a Colon or Comma, at which he might boggle and pleaſe his humour; yet it is but a poor advantage from the punctilio's of <hi>order and honour</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:172571:62"/>to argue againſt matters of moment, <hi>duties and exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and by <hi>miſplaced words</hi> to make an Oath or Solemn League <hi>illegal;</hi> I, but do I not run too faſt? he tells us <hi>he will not take the advantage;</hi> an honeſt man is indeed as good as his word; but I cannot truſt him; for his ninth Argument, <hi>This Covenant is derogatory to the Honour of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> England,
<note place="margin">Page 28.</note> is thus proved; <hi>The Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of</hi> England. I like not that mans grace, that with the ſame breath will <hi>remit and retort an indiſcretion;</hi> yet Sir, I cannot but enquire whether the preferring of the <hi>pompous gay-cloath'd Church of</hi> England before the poor Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> look not like a <hi>species</hi> of that impious partiality, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Can we think this Dr. had the <hi>faith of our</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, or was acted by ſuch a ſpirit of contradiction? No, this language was ſpoken after he was dead.</p>

               <p>The next <hi>Ambiguity</hi> is imagined by the Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be in the fourth Article, in the word <hi>Malignants;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fourth Ambiguity charged on the Covenant.</note> and they enquire <hi>who are to be accounted Malignants,</hi> as if it were left in its latitude, to be underſtood by every mans private fancy; whilſt it is expreſſely limited and explained in the Article it ſelf; <hi>ſuch as have been, or ſhall be Malignants, by hindring Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or one Kingdom

               <p>Again, they know not what are meant by the <hi>Supream Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of both Kingdoms;</hi> ſure they will not pretend to ignorance in the ſignification; they know well what a <hi>Judicatory</hi> is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Supream,</hi> almoſt every Engliſhman knoweth the ſence of theſe Roman terms.

               <p>I want, Sir, their eyes to read this contradiction; the firſt part, <hi>to preſerve,</hi> is legible in the Covenant: but, <hi>to extirpate the preſent Religion in the Church of</hi> Scotland, I read not; Oh, but they tell us, it is <hi>on a ſuppoſition;</hi> but I ſuppoſe, that <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> muſt be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in plain terms in the Covenant, to make <hi>a contradictory part thereof.</hi>

               <p>SIR, Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> in his attempt <hi>to looſen St. Peters bonds,</hi> (as he judgeth the Covenant to be) was willing to render the Covenant to be in reference to the matter thereof; <hi>a Religious Bond declaring a ſence of dutie to God, the King, the Church, their Country, and the Reformed Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 14.</note> to make men more <hi>ſtrictly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the ſacred, and civil obligations respectively due unto them, that ſo they might be more ready to diſcharge them in their places and callings;</hi> and hereby he doth eſtabliſh the obligation thereof; which, he not finding any way to avoid, doth endevour to limit, and contract into a narrow Room and Compaſſe; ſuppoſing the ſubjects thereof to be <hi>few, very few,</hi> and thoſe <hi>private men in their private capacitie,</hi> and ſo denominates it a <hi>Religious Bond which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, and ſome party only of the Nations ſpontaneouſly took upon themſelves,</hi> in ſence whereof he accommodates his <hi>ſolution of the Covenant</hi> unto private capacities endeavouring to abſolve them by a power which, he ſaith, is in themſelves: or to quiet them with a ſuggeſtion of impoſſibility to accompliſh their particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes againſt the purpoſe, and current of the Nation: how judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he hath managed the ſame, I have already ſhewed in my St. <hi>Peters bonds Abide,</hi> wherein, I did among other things, ſuggeſt my apprehenſion of the Covenant,
<note place="margin">Page 21.</note> in reſpect of the extent of its obligation, to be <hi>Publique and Nationall;</hi> I expected ſomething to have been ſaid by the Dr. againſt that ſuggeſtion; and the grounds from which it did ariſe, but find none; only in <hi>the Doubts and Scruples</hi> handed into the world by his Epiſtle, and offered to your, and my conſideration; he doth adhere to his own notion of the <hi>nature and private perſonall obligation of the Covenant,</hi> not urging one Reaſon for it, or anſwering any thing urged againſt it; how ingenuouſly this is done by a Caſuiſt, (that preſumed to releaſe from the obligation of ſacred bonds) let the world judge: I am
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:172571:74"/>therefore conſtrained to ſpeak out, and more plainly to aſſert what I was deſirous only to hint, and generally ſuggeſt; hoping thereby to have produced ſome ſerious diſcourſe, which might have acquitted our Nation, or have affected them with the Oath of God which abides upon them.</p>
               <p>When Sir, I ſay, the Solemn League and Covenant is <hi>Publick and National,</hi> I intend by it that which Civilians and Caſuiſts do ordinarily call <hi>Real,</hi> and as they oppoſe it unto <hi>private or perſonal,</hi> becauſe <hi>it reſteth not in any individual perſons, or particular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate number thereof;</hi> who may <hi>ſoon periſh,</hi> and ſo the obligation paſſe away with them, or be <hi>over-powred,</hi> and ſo put into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſbility of doing what they had ſworn: (as was <hi>Saul</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Jonathans Reſcue;</hi> and the men that confederated againſt <hi>Paul</hi>) the breach whereof ſubjects onely thoſe individual perſons unto the guilt or puniſhment of perjury, in non-effecting, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the thing covenanted: but abideth fixed <hi>in things and capacities, which continue and abide under all mutation of perſons,</hi> and ſo <hi>paſſe upon all perſons whatſoever,</hi> in al after ages, <hi>ad infinitum</hi> (if the Covenant be not limited) who ſhall ſucceed into thoſe things, places, or capacities; and ſo <hi>binde all perſons</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, whether inveſted, or repreſented by, and ſo involved in the ſame, unto the ſincere, faithful, diligent, and conſtant <hi>perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and purſuit of what is therein promiſ d:</hi> and in denial, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof, <hi>ſubjects them unto the guilt and puniſhment of perjury,</hi> ſo that the generations who never perſonally ſware the Covenant, ſucceeding into the capacities of their Progenitors, are bound unto the performance of the Oath, and ſhall be puniſhed many hundreds of years after it was made, and (it may be) ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was violated, in caſe of the breach of it: for ſo long as the <hi>publick capacity</hi> continueth, the perſons which ſucceed into it, ſucceed alſo into the obligation which lieth upon it, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of perſons voideth not the Oath: ſuch is the Oath of any body of people, whether a City or Nation, wherein the <hi>publick faith of that body Politick is engaged,</hi> and muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

I am ſure the <hi>Miniſterial rebukes,</hi> and <hi>confutations of the one,</hi> and publick <hi>Parliamentary debates</hi> of the other, will lay a very great remora unto their return: and his moſt Sacred Majeſty (to ſpeak it with due dread) being in his place bound from his Royal aſſent thereunto, I preſume will not only aw from propoſing to him any Laws that may reſtore any of them, but put an abſolute moral impoſſibility on the preſent paſſing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law to that purpoſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And, Sir, on ſecond thoughts, and a ſerious ſurveigh of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant, I cannot but obſerve, and ſee clearly, that firſt <hi>the matter therein Covenanted, is publike and national,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Kingdom under its <hi>Civil, Religious, and reformed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, or capacity,</hi> being the <hi>reformation and defence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> under a national profeſſion, and the <hi>honour and happineſſe of the King, priviledges of Parliament,</hi> and <hi>liberties of the Subjects,</hi> and the like concernments, no way proper for perſonal, and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, private Oaths.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe matters, and this form of ſecurity to them, were <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul ed, agitated, debated, determined, concluded, and agreed unto, by two diſtinct Nations;</hi> agreeing in the general capacities which did relate unto the matter thereof: and that in their <hi>moſt publike capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,</hi> and by the indiſputable, moſt full, and formal collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of both Kingdoms, the Parliament, though defective, in that part which was moſt neceſſary to eſtabliſh a Law, then indent a Covenant, which did moſt eminently conſiſt in the conſent of the people, and body of the Nations.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. The <hi>end and ſcope of this Covenant was Real, National, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> and only <hi>Perſonal,</hi> in relation thereunto: as is evident by the profeſſed grounds thereof, as <hi>having before our eyes the true pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique liberty, peace and ſafety of the Kingdoms (wherein every ones private condition is included)</hi> a ſence of the deplorable, diſtreſſed &amp;

               <p>Now, Sir, I ſay, when I have conſidered the Covenant under theſe publick conſiderations, and find ſuch palpable engagements made by the people of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>a Kingdom, and Political Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, profeſſing the Reformed Religion;</hi> I cannot but adhere to my former conjecture, that it <hi>looks ſomething like a National Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;</hi> nay, the confluence of <hi>publick aſſent and authority,</hi> by the people collectively and diſtributively conſidered; and <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Royal aſſent and concurrence</hi> (the defect of which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it at firſt leſs acceptable to many) leads my conjecture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full concluſion, <hi>that it is a publick National Covenant,</hi> bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the perſons of this Nation (that ſwear, or ſwear not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) and our poſterity after us, in their particular places; and all that ſhall ſucceed into the publick places, and politick capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdom, <hi>to preſerve and purſue</hi> the things therein promiſed, ſo long as it remains a Kingdom, <hi>under one King, and in the profeſſion of one Reformed Religion;</hi> which I pray and hope will be, till Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to judgment. Give me leave, Sir, to enforce this, with what I obſerved to be aſſerted by the Lord Chief Baron in his learned Speech unto the late condemned Traytors at the <hi>Old Baily, You were bound to bear Allegiance to your King; yea, though you may not have taken the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance your ſelves, yet you were bound by the Recognition of King</hi> James <hi>and His Poſterity, made at His firſt coming to the Crown of this Realm, by the whole Parliament, being the whole collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive body of the Kingdom:</hi> Certainly they then and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt needs be bound, who themſelves have <hi>univerſally</hi> by the appointment and authority of ſuch who were entruſted for them, engaged the Faith of the Nation; though it had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if the Parliament in that publick capacity had only done it; for I ſay ſtill, I ſee not how they can give away our Eſtates; or take pardons in the name, and to the ſecurity of the Nation; if they may not in our name make Oaths, Promiſes, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to bind us and our ſucceeding Governors and Poſterities; in ſenſe whereof, I cannot but deſire all that wiſh well to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>conſider the Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant;</hi> for, Sir, as it was no little ſupport and ſatisfaction to my ſpirit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the late contempt and horrid violations of the Covenant, to obſerve they were the prepoſterous Acts of Self-created Powers, and Uſurpers on the Peoples conſent, as well as His Majeſties
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:172571:80"/>Crown; and therefore could not involve the Nation in the guilt of their perjury, which our eyes have ſeen to fall upon their own heads; ſo it is now the greateſt perplexity in my jealouſie, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is like to be ſlighted, if not contradicted; that <hi>the Nation is in danger to be plunged under the guilt, and made liable to the puniſhment thereof,</hi> by that Juſt God, who will certainly avenge the quarrel of the Covenant; which God forbid! God forbid! I ſay again, God forbid!</p>
               <p>To conclude, Sir, this Section, leſt you or any others ſhould think, this quality of the Solemn League and Covenant, as <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and National,</hi> to be my own notion, and private particular fancy; give me leave to tell you and them, I can produce more than 600.

               <head>Sectio ſemptima. Prop. 7. <hi>The Obligation of the Solemn League and Covenant is permanent and abiding, never by any humane act or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be abſolved or diſcharged.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIR, By the <hi>permanency of the Obligation of the Covenant,</hi> we mean, the continuance of its Bond on the mind and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men; ſo that the Subjects thereof are, and for ever will be bound to purſue and perform the things and matters therein promiſed; nor is it in the power of any man, or humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to releaſe, acquit, or diſcharge them from the ſame; but that when, and howſoever the Solemn League and Covenant is ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, laid aſide, or violated, by any the Subjects thereof, they ſhall be liable unto the guilt and puniſhment of perjury in the breach thereof.</p>
               <p>This permanency of obligation, and impoſſibility of diſcharge, doth ſpring from a double cauſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The nature of an Oath,</hi> which is a ſolemn and ſerious Appeal to, and invocation of God, as <hi>Witneſs and Avenger</hi> of the thing ſworn, and ſincerity of the Subject ſwearing; ſo as in caſe of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, falſhood, or non-performance of the thing covenanted, we ſhall be liable unto the guilt and puniſhment of perjury, to be inflicted by the God who judgeth righteouſly.</p>
               <p>And 2ly. <hi>From the Manner and Form of the Covenant,</hi> which is <hi>abſolute, and without a condition,</hi> which might at any time fail, and ſo cauſe a Ceſſation of the Bond of the Covenant thereupon dependent; and is <hi>expreſſely excluſive to all manner of diſcharge</hi> or releaſe, by any humane Act or Power whatſoever, by an expreſs proteſt, <hi>That this Covenant we make in the preſence of Almighty God, the Searcher of all hearts, with a true intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to perform the ſame, as we ſhall anſwer at that great day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed;</hi> and by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar proviſion, <hi>That we ſhall never ſuffer our ſelves directly or indirectly, by whatſoever combination, perſwaſion or terrour, to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:172571:81"/>be divided or withdrawn from this bleſſed union and conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary part, or to give up our ſelves to a deteſtable neutrality in this cauſe, which ſo much concerneth the Glory of God, Good of the Kingdoms, and Honour of the King, but ſhall all the days of our lives zealouſly and conſtantly continue therein:</hi> So that the matter of this Covenant being, as I have before aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>good and lawful,</hi> becauſe <hi>juſt and poſſible;</hi> if there were in the World any power or perſons (entruſted with that divine Prerogative) to diſcharge the Obligation of an Oath; we could not receive it, becauſe it is actually and expreſly diſclaimed. We, Sir, live amongſt Proteſtants who by their very profeſſion do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt all <hi>Papal Dispenſations,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuitical Commutation,</hi> thereupon dependent; and therefore I need not ſtand to make any defence in this cauſe againſt the ſame, which would be to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſome Proteſtant Divines to be ſo Popiſhly affected, as to have recourſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> for relief againſt <hi>St. Peters Reſtraint:</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, Sir, <hi>Englands</hi> Biſhops would not be reputed Popiſh; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways to diſcharge the Obligation of the Covenant, we have none, ſave <hi>the releaſe of Superiors,</hi> which alwayes muſt be in ſuch caſes and manner, as are peculiar unto them, and proper to their cognizance.</p>
               <p>I am not inſenſible; that ſome ſuppoſe to themſelves, and ſuggeſt to others <hi>a nullity, or non-obliging force of the Covenant,</hi> by reaſon that <hi>His late Majeſty</hi> (of glorious Memory) <hi>did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict the Act;</hi> concerning which it is neceſſary to be enquired, Whether by the Light of Nature, Law of Nations, or Rule of Scripture, the Prince, <hi>the Political Parent,</hi> have ſuch full compleat Parental Authority over His Kingdom collectively or diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, as by His interdict to make void the Oath they put upon themſelves? 2. Whether the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> both, or either Houſe, can order, determine, direct, and by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Authority, enforce a preſent execution of thoſe Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and Orders directed to the Subject (as we know is, and ordinarily hath been practiſed) without the conſent of the King? And whether the people are not ſubject to the ſame, as being <hi>Parliamentary Authority,</hi> before they formally paſs into Laws or Acts, to be <hi>eſtabliſhed Rules,</hi> when their being a Parliament cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? And ſo whether an Act done, <hi>Sedente Parliamento,</hi> at their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:172571:82"/>Appointment, and by their preſent Order, being in its own nature permanent and abiding, never to be diſcharged (as is the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an Oath) be not valid, though it never paſs into <hi>a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Act of Parliament,</hi> and ſtanding Statute? 3. Whether an extraordinary and unuſual Proclamation of the King, againſt the Determinations of both Houſes of Parliament, be (according to the conſtitutions of this Kingdom) a full and formal ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas to any act required to be done by the authority of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſitting? 4. Whether his late Majeſty in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the 9th. of <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. <hi>Carol.</hi> did by his Royal Authority declare void and null the Obligation which ſhould be laid on any of his people againſt his conſent? Or by his Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal care onely admoniſh his Subjects of its evil, and the danger he conceived in it, and ſo warn a forbearance of it? For Parental Admonition, and Authoritative Annulling Inhibition, are diſtinct Acts; and the laſt was in this caſe neceſſary, becauſe the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Body of the Kingdom had ſworn this Covenant on the 25th. of <hi>September</hi> before. 5. Whether the Kings after-aſſent, and admonition unto a right underſtanding, and Religious keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Covenant, do not eſtabliſh it, and make its obligation unavoidable? And whether after the interdiction of the Act, his Majeſties Declaration, That <hi>as things now ſtand good, men ſhall leaſt offend God and Me, by keeping their Covenant by honeſt and lawful ways, ſince I have the Charity to believe, the chief end of the Covenant in ſuch mens intention, was to preſerve Religion in purity, and the Kingdoms in peace;</hi> Be not a ſubſequent allowance ſutable to the equity of that Law in <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. and ſufficient to make the Covenant valid, and an indiſpenſable vow? 6. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>an endeavour in our places and callings</hi> be not ſo far <hi>ſui Juris</hi> to the Subject, that it may be ſafely ſworn, without the conſent of the Soveraign, and ſhall bind the conſcience, notwithſtanding His declared diſſent thereunto? Laſtly, Whether the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of His moſt Gracious Majeſty that now is, unto the Solemn League and Covenant, and the Aſſent unto the Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament enjoyning the ſame, declared by Solemn Oath and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration, be not a full, compleat, and formal Authority, ſupplying all ſuppoſed defect, and faſtning its obligation by a full Theological, if not formally Political Act of Parliament? And ſo hath varied the caſe, and all fancy <hi>of the non-obligation of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:172571:82"/>Covenant,</hi> occaſioned by the unhappy diſpute concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority converſant about it? When, Sir, theſe enquiries are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and on ſolid Reaſons reſolved in the Negative, we ſhall confeſs, there may be ſome doubt of a diſcharge of the Obligation of the Covenant; and untill then, it lieth on our conſciences, and muſt be carefully regarded and performed, leſt the judgments of God come upon us, and we fall under the guilt of perjury.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, the matter of the Covenant being <hi>juſt and poſſible;</hi> the Authority eſtabliſhing it <hi>full and ſufficient;</hi> and diſpenſation from the Obligation of an Oath concluded to be <hi>a Popiſh Vanity;</hi> what can hinder our concluſion, that the Obligation of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant is permanent, never to be diſcharged? Yet Sir,</p>
               <p>Dr <hi>John Gauden,</hi> notwithſtanding his ill ſucceſs in <hi>looſing St. Peters Bonds,</hi> hath made an Eſſay for his full releaſe, though not immediately by himſelf (who can ſay no more then what he ſaid at firſt, and therefore ſaith it over again in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Doubts and Scruples</hi> before noted) yet by his profound allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and judicious teſtimony to the diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>John Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of <hi>Chinkford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> the which is made authentick and acceptable to the world as good Caſuiſtical Divinity, and a clear reſolution of this caſe of conſcience, by this ſtamp on the Title page, <hi>Atteſted by John Gauden D. D.</hi> So that, Sir, I ſhould be diſ-reſpective to my Antagoniſt, if I make not a little ſtay, to conſider what is ſaid by his learned Chaplain; though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is ſo ſimple and ſhatter'd a diſcourſe, it is not worth read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much leſs the leaſt of Anſwer: but I remember my promiſe at the beginning, <hi>That I would weigh what he could alledge to void the Covenant,</hi> which is his aim and profeſſed end; and therefore his Title page affirmeth, <hi>The Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſcharged; or, St. Peters Bonds not onely looſed but annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> An honourable deſign, an high undertaking, an hard enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, <hi>to releaſe the conſcience from the bond of an Oath!</hi> It is well if the attempt give us not cauſe to ſee <hi>Fronti nulla fides,</hi> and that the Title is ſtuffed <hi>with proud ſwelling words of vanity;</hi> yet he applieth himſelf to the work with ſome agility, as if accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to evade holy Bonds, and with eaſe to reſolve the moſt weighty caſes of conſciences, I will not ſay by a nimble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:172571:83"/>to break Religious Priſons; and therefore in <hi>page</hi> 2 of his Book, he ſtates the queſtion, and telleth us:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall grant by way of ſuppoſition</hi> (we will be content with ſuch a grant) <hi>all that the moſt rigid Covenanters can deſire of me, excepting one point; I ſhall ſuppoſe the ſame to be impoſed by compleat and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; to be no ways defective in circumſtances; to be clear and free from ambiguity; to be perfect in the form; to be ſound and lawful in the matter; to be pious in the end; fair in the manner of impoſing; that there was no fraud or violence uſed; but that all men took it with due deliberation and free conſent, by all which means it became a very ſtrong Bond and Obligation upon the conſciences of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, This is, I confeſs, <hi>a very fair grant;</hi> if notwithſtanding all this, he can diſcharge the Covenant, by my conſent he ſhall never more be brought into durance; but what is that one point he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to grant us?</p>
               <p>It is this, <hi>That the Solemn League and Covenant is ſuch a Bond on the conſciences of men, that it cannot be releaſed by any humane act or power.</hi> And in oppoſition thereto he affirmeth, That <hi>the ſame specifical power, or an higher than that which impoſed this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow upon us, may releaſe us from the ſame either tacitely or expreſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Sir, is eaſily affirmed with confidence, but ſo ſimply and ſlenderly proved, that the Doctor hath ſhewed us little of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his <hi>atteſtation</hi> to this work, as in his own <hi>Analyſis,</hi> and muſt needs make men obſerve his deſire of Releaſe is ſo fervent, as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and approve any thing that doth but pretend to diſcharge the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The firſt on-ſet in order to the proof of what is affirmed, is by a kind of Preface with relation to the Ordinance, enjoyning the taking of the Covenant, which he ſuppoſeth <hi>laid aſide, and not enlivened into an Act; and therefore he takes it to be dead in Law, and ſhall hold himſelf free from the Bond of the ſame:</hi> But, Sir, it will abide a Diſpute (againſt a ſtouter Polititian than I judge Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to be) whether His Majeſties aſſent teſtified by publick Oath and Declaration, to the Ordinance for taking
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172571:83"/>the Covenant, have not <hi>enlivened it into an Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ordinance may be <hi>dead in Law,</hi> and yet the Oath enjoyned by it <hi>alive in conſcience;</hi> for the one hath done its work in laying that obligation which now abideth, worketh, will work, and cannot be hindred; and then nothing but ignorance of the nature of an Oath, can lead a man to argue the Ordinance which brought me under it is dead. <hi>Ergo, I hold my ſelf thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward free from the Bond of the ſame.</hi> If St. <hi>Peter</hi> leap out at ſuch Loop-holes, he will be locked under heavy judgements: Is the Priſoner releaſed, becauſe the Warrant is of no more force, than to bring him into Priſon, and ſecure the Jaylour for keeping him therein?</p>
               <p>Having paſt this Preface, he proceeds to his Argumentative part, and makes a great pudder about the <hi>power of Superiours over their Subjects in private, particular and promiſſory Oaths;</hi> and <hi>with the instance of</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſervant, in the caſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a wife unto</hi> Iſaac; wherein, I ſhall grant unto him, that in all particular promiſſory Oaths, grounded on condition, it is in the power of confederates, whether Superiors or Equals, to relax the Obligation, <hi>by not exacting the performance;</hi> only I would tell him he is miſtaken in his inſtance <hi>of Abraham and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;</hi> for the Oath of the fervant was not releaſed by <hi>any act of Authority in Abraham;</hi> but if it had been releaſed, it had been by <hi>an impoſſibility of affecting the matter;</hi> and therefore the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants quaery <hi>on the peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this Land,</hi> was not a ſupplicate for an Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Releaſe; but a ſcrutiny into the Extent of the Oath; how far he was herein bound? which is plain by the quaery it ſelf, <hi>Muſt I needs bring thy ſon again into the Land from whence thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt?</hi> On which <hi>Paraeus</hi> noteth, that this was in the ſervant,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paraeus</hi> in Gen. 24.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Prudentia ſingularis, ne juret niſi de poſſibili;</hi> and therefore I muſt tell him, that I do not believe <hi>the father or husband,</hi> who may eſtabliſh the Vow <hi>of the Wife or Child,</hi> can afterward make it void again; and becauſe he may be unwilling to learn of me, I would commend Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> to be his Tutor, he will teach him one Leſſon which confuteth his whole Argument he would have managed, and the Notion on which he doth bottom it; <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem ſi expreſſo conſenſu ſuo, ſive Antecedente, ſive ſubſequente,

               <p>By this poſition, concerning particular, private, promiſſory Oaths, he pretends <hi>to pave his way to the grand question in hand, and as by by Rules in Military Diſcipline to make his approach at a reaſonable diſtance, and make good his firſt ground,</hi> on which he ſtands ſo ſure, that he advanceth not one ſtep higher; but as if at work in
<note n="*" place="margin">A rude and rough pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> done in the night, as tradition ſaith, by the Devil, who could not leave it till done.</note> 
                  <hi>Wakefield Pavement,</hi> or hurried about by ſome <hi>Fairy Dance,</hi> he traceth to and fro at all uncertainty, but is ſtill found in the ſame place unto the end of his Book; one while he <hi>can find no publick Covenants whereto to compare ours,</hi> which is of no moment; let him make good his Poſition by Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reaſon, we will admit our Covenant to become the firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Preſident. Another while he keeps a ſtir about <hi>the nature of the Covenant,</hi> which he will needs have to be in the Form of it, <hi>a civil and human Creature,</hi> ſubject to infirmity, to be taken away by men, and that it is <hi>an Oath,</hi> though the Heathen did ever make <hi>Juramentum</hi> and <hi>Religio</hi> to be ſynonimous in publick Contracts, becauſe an Oath was a moſt eminent Act of Religion; at length he ſtumbles out his notion and fancy in a Parable; and purſueth that, forgetting <hi>Theologia Parabolica non eſt Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva,</hi> that Parables prove nothing; but proving it to be <hi>verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis materia, ut huc illuc trahi imo &amp; duci poſſint,</hi> pliable to any wild and quick fancy, he endeavours to bend it to his purpoſe; but ſo very dully, that he cannot but loſe his end. He tells us that an Oath is <hi>a bringing a Trial into Gods Court, wherein the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers are the Plantiffs, the Covenanter, or him who ſweareth, is the Defendant, and God is the Judge;</hi> the which makes as good Muſick as <hi>Aſinus ad Lyram;</hi> all that I read, did ever make, not the ſwearing, but <hi>the exaction of the performance of an Oath,</hi> to be the Suit in Gods Court; and the Oath or Covenant to be the cauſe and ground on which the Suit is brought; and God as well as man to be the <hi>Plantiff,</hi> and a <hi>Party,</hi> as well as <hi>a Judge</hi> in every Oath, by reaſon whereof the Oath can never be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe no man can releaſe Gods Right and Intereſt in an Oath:

                     <hi>De Juram Praei. ſept. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 214.</note> So Dr. <hi>Saunderſon</hi> doth expreſly teach, <hi>In Juramento pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſorio non tantum proximo fit obligatio ſed &amp; Deo; praeſumptio igitur non ferenda eſſet, ſi terra &amp; cinis aſſumeret poteſtatem
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172571:84"/>tollendi obligationem qua homo obligatur Deo;</hi> which quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth his drift and aim, which is, <hi>That if men will not exact the Oath, or be content that it be not performed, God the Witneſs and Avenger, or Judge of it, is tyed up; and he will not expect it, or puniſh for the neglect of it:</hi> But Gods thoughts are not mens thoughts; he that ſweareth binds his ſoul unto the Lord, and muſt perform the thing that cometh out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>When his dull <hi>Genius</hi> had made a dark diſcovery of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Oath, he pretends to reſolve an Objection, <hi>That when the Covenant was adminiſtred, the Trial was finiſhed</hi> (he means founded, for the Suit was not commenced till performance be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted) <hi>and a Bond was put upon the conſciences of men by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God; and therefore we ſay no human power can take off this Bond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this he gives a moſt profound Anſwer, which thwarts and overthroweth the whole ſcope of his Book, and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear he is rowling <hi>Syſiphus ſtone,</hi> which ſtill returns upon him, and reneweth his labour; his Anſwer is, <hi>I ſay ſo too, what would you have more?</hi> Nothing, for it is enough; yet we muſt be directed how to think of him, <hi>I would not have you think that I have been ſtudying all this while to attribute a Pope-like power to my ſuperiors, to diſpence with the bond of an Oath that is already put upon my conſcience.</hi> No indeed, I rather think he is ſtudying how to looſen a pair of tyring Irons.</p>
               <p>But hath he no hole to creep out at, and evade his Anſwer, but thus expreſly overthrow his own deſign? yes! <hi>When what was ſworn is performed, we are free-men, unleſſe the Superiour gets us into a new Bond.</hi> That is very true, but what doth he infer? <hi>This is all that I expect, that the higher powers will not renew the Oath and Covenant, and then that buſineſs is at an end.</hi> But I doubt, Sir, he reckoned without his Hoſt; Hath he performed what he promiſed in the Covenant? it was thought to be work for all the days of his life; he is ſure a quick Merchant; or is he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo bad a Pay-maſter, that he will not perform any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he is conſtrained, by being haled to priſon? like a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, he dreams forbearance is an acquittance; and is ready to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172571:85"/>begin a new ſcore of Covenants, if any man be ſo mad as to truſt him; if he can be ſecured from any new Bond, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will never make him pay the old; he had need to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or otherwiſe he is reſolved to be diſcharged: But I believe ſecond thoughts will make him to ſee, he had need to pay for the old, before he be truſted for new; when he dreams the Tryal is ended, the Suit is but beginning; what though the Higher Power never renew the Covenant, will that cancel the Bond given to God? if he agree not with his Adverſary quickly, he will be caſt into priſon; verily he muſt not come thence, till he have paid the utmoſt Mite; nor will it make a Plea to the leaſt mitigation of damages, to ſay, Lord, <hi>My Superiours did never require me to renew the Covenant!</hi> His Majeſty is like to have Loyal Subjects at <hi>Chinkeford,</hi> where they are taught, that their Allegiance being once performed, if the King do not cauſe them daily to renew the Oath of Allegiance, they are free to turn Rebels and Traytors, for any thing they had ſworn before: This is an <hi>Eſſex</hi> — much cheaper, and more eaſily to be had than a Popes Bull; if I be not by the impoſer exacted and required to perform, I am <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> releaſed; he ſhall never want Clients, that can make ſuch Releaſes; yet you muſt note, this he manageth with moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeriouſneſs, as reaching <hi>the very myſtery and depth of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, he hath Salvo's for his Diſtinction; and Reaſons for his Aſſertion; <hi>What is pious, good and lawful in the Covenant, doth ſtill bind</hi> per vim Praecepti, <hi>but not</hi> per vim Juramenti; <hi>and if he perform not the contents or intents of the ſame, he is guilty of diſobedience, but not of perjury.</hi> What a dull Buzzard am I? How have I ſpent my time, that never learned this Notion in Divinity before? I had once a Tutour commended to me by Dr. <hi>Chappel,</hi> and he makes me believe, the ſoul might at the ſame time be under <hi>a double Bond</hi> to the ſame Act; the ſingle tye of the goodneſs and lawfulneſs of the Act, and the Cords of an Oath or Covenant, and that the laſt was the ſtricteſt Bond; he tortured my conſcience with the thoughts of <hi>a complicated ſin,</hi> in not doing a duty ſworn to be done, and the guilt of both, <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and perjury.</hi> I muſt ſure leave him, and take unto Mr <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> atteſted by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> he teacheth a ſmoother way to Hell.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172571:85"/>for where we are under a Duty, and an Oath to do it, in not doing it I ſhall be but damned for the leaſt ſin, the diſobedience, not the perjury.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was never yet denied, that in a promiſſory Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private perſons, be to whom the promiſe was made, if he will releaſe, he may releaſe;</hi> if he had for <hi>never</hi> directed us to read <hi>ever;</hi> this had been an intelligent obſervation; for it hath ever been denied, that any man could releaſe <hi>the Oath,</hi> Dr. <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> denieth it, and <hi>Grotius</hi> denieth it, and I deny it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Ralaxation of the matter</hi> of the promiſe, which is to them <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> and <hi>the Releaſe of the Oath,</hi> which is Gods proper intereſt; I may remit my profit or benefit, and yet not releaſe an Oath; by his leave Sir, I do again deny, That <hi>Abraham did releaſe his ſervant;</hi> that which he dreames of to be a Releaſe, was part of the very <hi>Indenture of the Covenant or Oath,</hi> that the ſervant might ſee the matter of it in its Extent; but ſpare me Sir, what is all this to the purpoſe? it is to be proved that the Solemn League and Covenant is ſuch <hi>a promiſſory Oath;</hi> it was indeed agreed, concluded, and conſented unto by two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but yet it is not <hi>a reciprocal promiſe</hi> each unto other, that they may at any time relax each to other the whole, or any part of the conditions thereof; but is <hi>a joynt Oath or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ow</hi> to God, by mutual Agreement put on the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then to follow his fancy, <hi>God,</hi> and God only, <hi>is the Plantiff,</hi> and no Higher Powers of either Kingdom, but they as Members of the Kingdoms are <hi>Defendants;</hi> whom God impleads to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they are bound to do. His promiſe was to prove the Covenant to be <hi>of the nature of a promiſſory Oath,</hi> which might be releaſed, and this I expected; but I would have him take time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it in, I will expect his Reſolution at Doomſ-day, when the Tryal ſhall be undoubtedly ended, and the Judge will openly declare his ſentence againſt all who have broken, or ſhall break the Covenant, though not renewed at the command of the Higher Powers.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman tells the World, That <hi>Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at Dr.</hi> Gaudens <hi>Logick, in arguing the evil of it, from the unbleſt effects and conſequences of the Covenant;</hi> And I think
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:172571:86"/>Sir he had Reaſon; for <hi>Event was never judged a Rule of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but the unbleſt effects reflected on the Covenant, did only accompany it, not ſprung from it, as its proper brood, and natural iſſue by it procreated, Shall wicked mens reluctancy to piety and order, or perfidy and contempt of the Oath of God create evil effects, accidental ſequels to the Covenant, and it be condemned? Sir, this man is ſure half an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and thinks Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Adam</hi> to have been the cauſe of mans Fall: Is he not rather half an heathen, that in all Tumults, Earth-quakes, and Plagues of God upon them, would cry out, <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> as if they were the cauſe of all? Let any of them ſpecifie that evil in the Covenant, which hath a natural tendency unto theſe <hi>unbleſt,</hi> or let him ſpeak out, <hi>curſt effects;</hi> and I will damn it as an accurſed thing: But Sir, Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> did not ſo much wonder at the Drs. Logick in this Argument, as at his little Reaſon or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in giving his <hi>Attestation</hi> to ſuch an Irrational, Atheologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Wild and Wicked Diſcourſe as this is; whilſt he fears the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter is <hi>righteous over-much;</hi> I would adviſe him to conſider whether the next words do not ſuit his ſpirit, as proper for his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:172571:86"/>but muſt be bold to ſay, our Oaths (being of matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Scripture) are ready Dictators (as well as Spurs) unto our Duty; and (in things meerly humane, morally good, though not neceſſary) the compaſs which ſhould ſteer our courſe; I must confeſs I cannot but be grieved to ſee ſome Tranſactions amongst us, unto a contempt, nay, contradiction of the</hi> Covenant; <hi>might but my poor weak papers provoke more able and ſerious Caſuiſts in good earnest, as before God, and in the dread of an Oath, to ſtate, and (by right Religious Reaſon) to reſolve this caſe of conſcience; though in the Negative I had obtained my deſire, and (if I know my own heart) none ſhall be more ready then my ſelf (when convinced)</hi> to fall down and worſhip, and confeſs God is in them of a truth. <hi>I muſt Sir, beg your pardon wherein I appear too tedious; the weight of the Argument, the number and worth of the Antagoniſts, ſpeak ſomething in Apology for me.
